              The potential of quantum computers to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers has driven advances in hardware fabrication. In practice, the main challenge in realizing quantum computers is that general, many-particle quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which inevitably causes errors in quantum algorithms. Some noise sources are inherent to the current materials platforms. de Leon

              {BACKGROUND}
              The past two decades have seen intense efforts aimed at building quantum computing hardware with the potential to solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. Several hardware platforms for quantum information processing ({QIP}) are under active development. To realize large-scale systems based on these technologies, we must achieve error rates much lower than have been demonstrated thus far in a scalable platform, or devise a new platform entirely. These activities will require major advances in materials science and engineering, new fabrication and synthesis techniques, and new measurement and materials analysis techniques. We identify key materials challenges that currently limit progress in five quantum computing hardware platforms, propose how to tackle these problems, and discuss some new areas for exploration. Addressing these materials challenges will necessitate interdisciplinary approaches from scientists and engineers beyond the current boundaries of the quantum computing field.
            
            
              {ADVANCES}
              This Review constitutes a roadmap of the current challenges and opportunities for materials science in quantum information processing. We provide a comprehensive review of materials issues in each physical platform by describing the evidence that has led to the current understanding of each problem. For each platform, we present reasons for particular material choices, survey the current understanding of sources of noise and dissipation, describe materials limitations to scaling, and discuss potential new material platforms. Despite major differences among physical implementations in each hardware technology, there are several common themes: Material selection is driven by heterogeneity, impurities, and defects in available materials. Poorly controlled and characterized surfaces lead to noise and dissipation beyond limits imposed by bulk properties. Scaling to larger systems gives rise to new materials problems that are not evident in single-qubit measurements.
            
            
              {OUTLOOK}
              We identify three principal materials research frontiers of interest in this context. First, understanding the microscopic mechanisms that lead to noise, loss, and decoherence is crucial. This would be accelerated by developing high-throughput methods for correlating qubit measurement with direct materials spectroscopy and characterization. Second, relatively few material platforms for solid-state {QIP} have been explored thus far, and the discovery of a new platform is often serendipitous. It is thus important to develop materials discovery pipelines that exploit directed, rational material searches in concert with high-throughput characterization approaches aimed at rapid screening for properties relevant to {QIP}. Third, there are several materials issues that do not affect single-qubit operations but appear as limitations in scaling to larger systems. Many problems faced by these platforms are reminiscent of some that have been addressed over the past five decades for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor electronics and other areas of the semiconductor industry, and approaches and solutions adopted by that industry may be applicable to {QIP} platforms. Materials issues will be critical to address in the coming years as we transition from noisy intermediate-scale systems to large-scale, fault-tolerant systems. Quantum computing began as a fundamentally interdisciplinary effort involving computer science, information science, and quantum physics; the time is now ripe for expanding the field by including new collaborations and partnerships with materials science.

            Quantum computing hardware technologies have advanced during the past two decades, with the goal of building systems that can solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. The ability to realize large-scale systems depends on major advances in materials science, materials engineering, and new fabrication techniques. We identify key materials challenges that currently limit progress in five quantum computing hardware platforms, propose how to tackle these problems, and discuss some new areas for exploration. Addressing these materials challenges will require scientists and engineers to work together to create new, interdisciplinary approaches beyond the current boundaries of the quantum computing field.},

	abstract = {As we begin to reach the limits of classical computing, quantum computing has emerged as a technology that has captured the imagination of the scientific world. While for many years, the ability to execute quantum algorithms was only a theoretical possibility, recent advances in hardware mean that quantum computing devices now exist that can carry out quantum computation on a limited scale. Thus it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this time, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of interest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum computers is Feynman's idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. Such systems are found across chemistry, physics, and materials science. The particular way in which quantum computing extends classical computing means that one cannot expect arbitrary simulations to be sped up by a quantum computer, thus one must carefully identify areas where quantum advantage may be achieved. In this review, we briefly describe central problems in chemistry and materials science, in areas of electronic structure, quantum statistical mechanics, and quantum dynamics, that are of potential interest for solution on a quantum computer. We then take a detailed snapshot of current progress in quantum algorithms for ground-state, dynamics, and thermal state simulation, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for future developments.},

Carrying out these calculations requires an error-corrected quantum architecture that we describe. Our estimates showcase that recent developments on quantum phase estimation algorithms have dramatically reduced the quantum resources needed to run fully quantum calculations in active spaces of around 50 orbitals and electrons, from estimated over 1000 years using the Trotterization approach to just a few days with sparse qubitization, painting a picture of fast and exciting progress in this nascent field.},

              The rapid advancement of quantum computing has sparked a considerable increase in research attention to quantum technologies. These advances span fundamental theoretical inquiries into quantum information and the exploration of diverse applications arising from this evolving quantum computing paradigm. The scope of the related research is notably diverse. This paper consolidates and presents quantum computing research related to the financial sector. The finance applications considered in this study include portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing and risk calculation. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of quantum computing’s applications and effects on blockchain technologies, particularly in relation to cryptocurrencies, which are central to financial technology research. As discussed in this study, quantum computing applications in finance are based on fundamental quantum physics principles and key quantum algorithms. This review aims to bridge the research gap between quantum computing and finance. We adopt a two-fold methodology, involving an analysis of
              quantum algorithms
              , followed by a discussion of
              their applications
              in specific financial contexts. Our study is based on an extensive review of online academic databases, search tools, online journal repositories, and whitepapers from 1952 to 2023, including {CiteSeerX}, {DBLP}, {ResearchGate}, Semantic Scholar, and scientific conference publications. We present state-of-the-art findings at the intersection of finance and quantum technology and highlight open research questions that will be valuable for industry practitioners and academicians as they shape future research agendas.},

	abstract = {The expected societal impact of quantum technologies ({QT}) urges us to proceed and innovate responsibly. This article proposes a conceptual framework for Responsible {QT} that seeks to integrate considerations about ethical, legal, social, and policy implications ({ELSPI}) into quantum R\&amp;D, while responding to the Responsible Research and Innovation dimensions of anticipation, inclusion, reflection and responsiveness. After examining what makes {QT} unique, we argue that quantum innovation should be guided by a methodological framework for Responsible {QT}, aimed at jointly safeguarding against risks by proactively addressing them, engaging stakeholders in the innovation process, and continue advancing {QT} ({SEA}). We further suggest operationalizing the {SEA}-framework by establishing quantum-specific guiding principles. The impact of quantum computing on information security is used as a case study to illustrate (1) the need for a framework that guides Responsible {QT}, and (2) the usefulness of the {SEA}-framework for {QT} generally. Additionally, we examine how our proposed {SEA}-framework for responsible innovation can inform the emergent regulatory landscape affecting {QT}, and provide an outlook of how regulatory interventions for {QT} as base-layer technology could be designed, contextualized, and tailored to their exceptional nature in order to reduce the risk of unintended counterproductive effects of policy interventions. Laying the groundwork for a responsible quantum ecosystem, the research community and other stakeholders are called upon to further develop the recommended guiding principles, and discuss their operationalization into best practices and real-world applications. Our proposed framework should be considered a starting point for these much needed, highly interdisciplinary efforts.},

	abstract = {Quantum information technologies, covering quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing, are among the most significant technologies to emerge in recent decades, offering the promise of paradigm-shifting computational capacity with significant ethical consequences. On a technical level, the unique features of quantum information processing have consequences for the imposition of fairness and ethical constraints on computation. Despite its significance, little if no structured research has been undertaken into the ethical implications of such quantum technologies. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature by presenting a roadmap for ethical quantum computing (and quantum information processing more generally) that sets out prospective research programmes. We summarise the key elements of quantum information processing (focusing on quantum computation) relevant to ethical analysis and set-out taxonomies for use by researchers considering the ethics of quantum technologies. In particular, we demonstrate how the unique features of quantum information processing gives rise to distinct ethical consequences (including in the context of machine learning). We situate quantum ethics at the cross-disciplinary intersection of quantum information science, technology ethics and moral philosophy to assess the impacts of this newly emerging technology. We provide specific examples of how the emergence of quantum technologies gives rise to normative and distributional ethical challenges. Finally, we set out prospective research directions to help inaugurate the cross-disciplinary field of the ethics of quantum computing.},

The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the {SLR} indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this {SLR} can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.},

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.},

            Quantum computers are designed to outperform standard computers by running quantum algorithms. Areas in which quantum algorithms can be applied include cryptography, search and optimisation, simulation of quantum systems and solving large systems of linear equations. Here we briefly survey some known quantum algorithms, with an emphasis on a broad overview of their applications rather than their technical details. We include a discussion of recent developments and near-term applications of quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {While significant progress has been made on the hardware side of quantum computing, support for high-level quantum programming abstractions remains underdeveloped compared to classical programming languages. In this article, we introduce Qrisp, a framework designed to bridge several gaps between high-level programming paradigms in state-of-the-art software engineering and the physical reality of today's quantum hardware. The framework aims to provide a systematic approach to quantum algorithm development such that they can be effortlessly implemented, maintained and improved. We propose a number of programming abstractions that are inspired by classical paradigms, yet consistently focus on the particular needs of a quantum developer. Unlike many other high-level language approaches, Qrisp's standout feature is its ability to compile programs to the circuit level, making them executable on most existing physical backends. The introduced abstractions enable the Qrisp compiler to leverage algorithm structure for increased compilation efficiency. Finally, we present a set of code examples, including an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm. For the latter, the resulting circuit shows significantly reduced quantum resource requirements, strongly supporting the claim that systematic quantum algorithm development can give quantitative benefits.},

It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succinct expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q\#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms. Q\# provides a type system, a tightly constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax, symbolic code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations, and powerful functional constructs which aid composition.},

	abstract = {With the potential of quantum algorithms to solve intractable classical problems, quantum computing is rapidly evolving, and more algorithms are being developed and optimized. Expressing these quantum algorithms using a high-level language and making them executable on a quantum processor while abstracting away hardware details is a challenging task. First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations. In this article, we propose a quantum programming framework named {OpenQL}, which includes a high-level quantum programming language and its associated quantum compiler. We present the programming interface of {OpenQL}, we describe the different layers of the compiler and how we can provide portability over different qubit technologies. Our experiments show that {OpenQL} allows the execution of the same high-level algorithm on two different qubit technologies, namely superconducting qubits and Si-Spin qubits. Besides the executable code, {OpenQL} also produces an intermediate quantum assembly code, which is technology independent and can be simulated using the {QX} simulator.},

Nevertheless, just like any other concept or field, it has some challenges, and a lot of research and work need to be done to realize its capabilities and benefits. This review provides an insight into quantum computing models coupled with the identification of some pros and cons. The main contribution of this systematic review is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art models of quantum computing in various domains. It provides new classifications of quantum models based on the literature reviewed and links results to that of the four major categories of quantum computing models. Assessment reveals that most of the models reviewed are either mathematical or algorithmic even though they are based on quantum operations and circuits.},

However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 109 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

            This paper intends to contribute to the emerging literature on the ethical problems posed by quantum computing and quantum technologies in general. The key ethical questions are as follows: Does quantum computing pose new ethical problems, or are those raised by quantum computing just a different version of the same ethical problems raised by other technologies, such as nanotechnologies, nuclear plants, or cloud computing? In other words, what is new in quantum computing from an ethical point of view? The paper aims to answer these two questions by (a) developing an analysis of the existing literature on the ethical and social aspects of quantum computing and (b) identifying and analyzing the main ethical problems posed by quantum computing. The conclusion is that quantum computing poses completely new ethical issues that require new conceptual tools and methods.},
