These techniques are based on rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction. Separating and later recombining a singlet spin state provided a measurement of the spin dephasing time,

              *, of ∼10 nanoseconds, limited by hyperfine interactions with the gallium arsenide host nuclei. Rabi oscillations of two-electron spin states were demonstrated, and spin-echo pulse sequences were used to suppress hyperfine-induced dephasing. Using these quantum control techniques, a coherence time for two-electron spin states exceeding 1 microsecond was observed.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to help humanity solve problems that would otherwise be intractable on classical computers. Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities: 1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems. 2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines. 3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure. This paper discusses each in turn.},

The network drives cross-domain interaction to accelerate learning and coordination towards building a secure quantum economy through inter-linked workstreams around applications, cybersecurity and governance. The {challengeQuantum} computing, though at its early stages, will help provide significant advances in computing capabilities and will have a considerable impact on improving the state of the world in the coming years. It could have a revolutionary impact on human well-being, national security and global society, along with potential commercial applications across industries.With the emergence of the quantum ecosystem around the world, inherent risks of relying on quantum computing have emerged in a number of areas. Will quantum computing add to the risks as well as benefits of an algorithm-based society? Are there new challenges? Will the public trust technologies which they cannot understand and whose results they cannot verify? Will quantum computers be able to break existing cryptographic standards? Who will have access to the new technologies? The {opportunityThe} most appropriate and effective time to consider the ethical implications of a technology is when that technology is still in the design and development phase, as it allows for early intervention. Ethical concerns in quantum computing are just starting to be discussed, however, guidelines do not yet exist globally. Drawing on the learnings of ethical principles and approaches to mitigating risks and unintended consequences in other emerging technologies like {AI}, nanotech, nuclear energy and {GMOs}, there is a need to study the ethical implications of the technology. Quantum computing-related risks can be mitigated through a selection of effective governance and policy measures, while creating awareness among relevant stakeholders. Developing effective guidelines for the public and private sectors, academia and other stakeholders is timely in order to promote the adoption of responsible quantum computing.{ImpactThis} initiative brings together a global multistakeholder community of experts from across the public sector and private sectors, academia and civil society to formulate principles and create a broader framework for responsible and purpose-driven design and adoption of quantum computing technologies to drive positive outcomes for society.  Our approach:Frame stakeholder conversations and create ecosystem awareness of how quantum ethics can be used to create a better society Study the inherent risks, ethical questions, societal implications and other unknown impacts associated with quantum computing Design quantum computing governance {principlesDesign} a broader framework for the responsible design and adoption of quantum computing Test the framework in a few emerging applications of quantum computing to be identified by the expert {communityHow} to {engageProject} community: Nominate quantum experts, policymakers, emerging technologies ethics experts, or senior executives to provide ongoing input on the {projectFellow}: Nominate an individual from your organization to play an integral role in shaping this initiative},

Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature.

No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities: 1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems. 2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines. 3. Access.

Hirst, University of {NottinghamMikhail} Lukin, Harvard {UniversityGrant} M. Rotskoff, Stanford {UniversitySabrina} Maniscalco, Algorithmiq Inc.Sergii Strelchuk, University of Oxford   Quantum computing promises to have wide-ranging impact on many aspects of our lives including our health. But how? And when? These are the questions often asked and the ones that generate both optimism and skepticism about quantum computing applications. We do know that the early days of any new computational method benefit from the co-development of application, software, and hardware – allowing early optimizations with not-yet-generalizable, early systems. And history has shown us that the disciplines that begin this interaction early are also ones that advance and benefit most. The Wellcome Leap Quantum for Bio program aims to accelerate applications of quantum computing in health and demonstrate quantum-enabled solutions to address pressing human health challenges.The power of quantum computing stems from the unique properties of quantum systems, notably: superposition, interference, and quantum correlations. When these properties are exploited for information processing, quantum computing enables solutions to problems that are not practical using classical computers. Examples of such problems include finding the prime factors of large numbersi (the basis of most public key cryptography methods), high-accuracy quantum chemical calculations (the cornerstone of drug designii, iii), and unstructured data base searchiv. Quantum algorithms for these problems and other industry-specific applications (e.g., elucidating the reaction mechanism of nitrogen fixation in nitrogenasev or calculating the electronic structure properties of hemoproteins to elucidate drug-drug interactionsvi) offer exponential or polynomial speed-up compared to their classical counterparts and require quantum computers at scales not realized to date.Inspired by the promise of quantum computing, strides are being made toward large-scale quantum computers capable of outperforming even the fastest supercomputers possible. Notably, in 2019, a quantum computer based on superconducting circuits performed a mathematical benchmark task on a 253-dimensional computation state-space in 200 seconds that would have taken over 10,000 years on the most powerful classical computers available at the timevii – experimentally demonstrating for the first time the exponential speed-up between a quantum and a classical algorithm. But because quantum computers are inherently sensitive to outside perturbations, scaling them up is a considerable technological challenge. Today’s quantum computers remain limited in size and computational power, which in turn limits their practical application. For example, the largest quantum chemical calculation with chemical accuracy performed on a quantum computer to date is finding the binding energy of a 12-atom hydrogen chain (H12)viii, a problem within reach of classical computers.One promising area where quantum computing could deliver near-term practical advantage is in human health applicationsix, where biological data can be represented more efficiently on a quantum computer compared to a classical computer. For example, the haploid human genome is around 3.2 billion base pairs long and can be represented by 6.4 x 109 classical bits or around 750 {MBx}. In quantum computing, the analogue to the classical bit is a quantum bit (qubit), that can be in a superposition state between 0 and 1. A quantum register with N qubits is in a superposition of 2n possible states with amplitudes, where each can encode a classical bit. Hence, it is in principle possible to store the entire human genome in just 33 qubits, while less than 100 qubits would be required to store the genetic information of every living person on the planet.Indeed, sequencing of the human genome led to the generation of genomic data that is predicted to reach between 2 and 40 exabytes within the next decadexi, and 3D protein structure prediction involve similarly large and expanding data sets. These technological developments require the application of statistical and machine learning methods for data mining to make predictions relevant to research and clinical work. In drug discovery, computationally intensive methods are used to forecast molecular properties, ligand-protein binding, secondary structures, and more. For such applications, quantum machine learning algorithmsxii promise to outperform their classical counterparts and enable handling larger data sets.More than 40 experiments on proof-of-concept quantum computing applications in human health have been carried out in the last few years, including applications in clinical research and discovery, diagnostics, and treatments/interventions such as ligand-protein interaction energy calculations via a hybrid quantum-classical approachxiii, medical image classification via quantum neural networksxiv, and studying the mechanism of biological catalysts that play an important role in breaking and forming of chemical bondsxv. To date, however, none of these methods have produced substantial quantum computing speed-up compared to high-performance classical computing for industry-scale problems.Two parameters define the capacity for problem solving of quantum devices, jointly referred to as quantum computing resources: first, the number of qubits, which determine the size of the computational space; and second, computational runtime, otherwise known as program depth. In Fig. 1 the quantum computing resources required for several applications are shown in log-log scale together with the capabilities of current quantum computers. There is a gap between quantum hardware and algorithmic resources that needs to be closed – doing so will illustrate the beginning of useful quantum computing and there is now a race toward demonstrations of practical quantum advantage for near-term quantum devices.Wellcome Leap’s Supported Challenge Program in Quantum for Bio is focused on identifying, developing, and demonstrating biology and healthcare applications that will benefit from the quantum computers expected to emerge in the next 3-5 years. Up to \$40M in research funding will be awarded to multidisciplinary, multiorganizational teams and up to \$10M in challenge prizes will be available at the end of the program for successful proof-of-concept demonstrations on quantum devices with a clear path to scaling to large quantum computers.Notably, we are interested in the development of algorithms that will be realizable on quantum computers expected to emerge in the next 3-5 years; estimated to be able to execute programs with 100 to 200 qubits and depths of O(105-107), which we refer to as the target resources.                  Figure 1. The quantum computing resources for several important applications and the current capabilities of quantum devices. The inset box, target resources, defines the computing resources in terms of qubits and program depth that submitted proposals should aim for.       Examples of areas of interest. We are soliciting proposals for algorithmic solutions to human health problems whose quantum computational resources fit into the target resources box in Fig. 1. As an example, quantum search algorithms can be used to perform pattern matching for {DNA} sequence alignment with a polynomial algorithmic speed up compared to classical, direct brute-force search algorithms. The quantum Grover search algorithm for human genome assembly with short reads of 50 base pairs lengths is estimated to require 133 qubitsxvi. However, the estimated program depth for this task is O(1014-1016), which translates to days and weeks of runtime. This is beyond the capabilities of the quantum devices that will be available in the next 3-5 years. To enable quantum speed-up for sequencing on near term quantum computers, we need to develop more efficient information encoding, decoding, and processing methods, thereby reducing the number of required qubits, which in turn will reduce the depth of the algorithm.Another representative example is physics-based ab-initio prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids. Sampling the conformational space of proteins is intrinsically {NP}-hard and classical ab-initio protein folding algorithms have been replaced by deep learning algorithms with good but not perfect accuracy and applicability. The benefit of using quantum computers stem from their ability to efficiently sample the exponentially growing conformational space, which will extend the applicability and accuracy of protein folding predictions and shed light on the mechanistic process itself. Early attempts at formulating the protein folding problem for small, noisy quantum computers showed a model Hamiltonian with O(N4) scaling for a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice, while the number of qubits scales quadratically with N. This hybrid algorithm was implemented experimentally on a quantum computing device with 9 superconducting qubits and program depth {\textasciitilde}O(101) for the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptidexvii. The most abundant proteins in the human body have lengths of several hundred to dozens of thousands amino acids. In order to benefit from the power of quantum computers for larger proteins however, we will need novel approaches for qubit and program depth minimization. Additionally, we will need more realistic descriptions of the amino acid side chains and a more systematic treatment of the long-range interactions.   Format of Wellcome Leap’s Quantum for Bio Supported Challenge Program.The program will take place over three phases as diagrammed below:                Phase 1: A maximum of 12 cross-disciplinary proposals will be selected for funding and will participate in Phase 1. Each team should include expertise in human health and quantum algorithm development – quantum hardware expertise is encouraged but not required for this phase of the program. A maximum of \$1.5M in funding will be awarded to each team selected for funding in Phase 1, which will be twelve (12) months in duration.The focus of Phase 1 is quantum algorithm development where the quantum computing resources (number of qubits and program depth) required should fit within the target resources box in Fig. 1. The technical progress and deliverables of Phase 1 will be evaluated and tracked by the Wellcome Leap Quantum for Bio Program Director ({PD}) and an expert internal technical team. The final evaluation of Phase 1 will be conducted with the help of 4 additional, external subject matter experts in quantum computing and human health. Teams that are deemed to have demonstrated a significant advance for human health within the defined target resources will proceed to Phase 2.Phase 2: The focus of Phase 2 is large-scale simulations of the developed algorithms in Phase 1 using classical high-performance computing ({HPC}). Teams will be awarded a maximum of \$500K in funding for {HPC} expenses and up to \$250K for other related technical and programmatic execution expenses. Phase 2 will be six (6) months in duration and at the end of Phase 2, all teams will be required to have identified and secured quantum hardware expertise participation on their team in order to be considered for progression to Phase 3.Progress in Phase 2 will be evaluated and tracked by the Wellcome Leap Quantum for Bio {PD} and technical team. To successfully complete Phase 2, teams will perform a classical {HPC} simulation of their quantum algorithm for 30 to 40 qubits and compare the results to the ones obtained by the standard classical approach for the respective application. Wellcome Leap’s internal technical team aided by external {HPC} subject matter expert(s), as needed, will decide which teams successfully complete Phase 2 and proceed to the final Phase 3.Phase 3: The focus of this phase is implementing the developed algorithmic solutions on quantum computing devices. A maximum of \$2M in funding will be awarded to the fully integrated teams for Phase 3, which will be twelve (12) months in duration. Phase 3 technical deliverables will be evaluated and tracked by the Wellcome Leap Quantum for Bio internal team as a condition for entry to judging for prize awards. The final evaluation of the Wellcome Leap’s Supported Challenge Program results will be conducted by an integrated team that consists of the internal technical team and 4 or more external subject matter experts in healthcare and quantum computing.Prizes.A \$2M prize will be awarded for each team that successfully demonstrates an experimental realization of their application on a quantum computer with more than 50 qubits and a program depth of O(103-104) and a clear path to scaling to larger quantum computers.A \$5M grand prize will be awarded to one team that successfully executes their algorithm on a quantum computer using quantum resources that fit into the target resources box in Fig. 1. In case there is more than one team that achieves this goal, the team of experts that perform the final evaluation will award the grand prize to the team whose application is deemed to be most significant for advancing human health.

	abstract = {Quantum computers have made extraordinary progress over the past decade, and significant milestones have been achieved along the path of pursuing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. Quantum advantage, the tipping point heralding the quantum era, has been accomplished along with several waves of breakthroughs. Quantum hardware has become more integrated and architectural compared to its toddler days. The controlling precision of various physical systems is pushed beyond the fault-tolerant threshold. Meanwhile, quantum computation research has established a new norm by embracing industrialization and commercialization. The joint power of governments, private investors, and tech companies has significantly shaped a new vibrant environment that accelerates the development of this field, now at the beginning of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we first discuss the progress achieved in the field of quantum computation by reviewing the most important algorithms and advances in the most promising technical routes, and then summarizing the next-stage challenges. Furthermore, we illustrate our confidence that solid foundations have been built for the fault-tolerant quantum computer and our optimism that the emergence of quantum killer applications essential for human society shall happen in the future.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {Quantum technology is an emergent and potentially disruptive discipline, with the ability to affect many human activities. Quantum technologies are dual-use technologies, and as such are of interest to the defence and security industry and military and governmental actors. This report reviews and maps the possible quantum technology military applications, serving as an entry point for international peace and security assessment, ethics research, military and governmental policy, strategy and decision making. Quantum technologies for military applications introduce new capabilities, improving effectiveness and increasing precision, thus leading to `quantum warfare', wherein new military strategies, doctrines, policies and ethics should be established. This report provides a basic overview of quantum technologies under development, also estimating the expected time scale of delivery or the utilisation impact. Particular military applications of quantum technology are described for various warfare domains (e.g. land, air, space, electronic, cyber and underwater warfare and {ISTAR} -- intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance), and related issues and challenges are articulated.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} potential of achieving computational hardware with quantum advantage depends heavily on the quality of quantum gate operations. However, the presence of imperfect two-qubit gates poses a significant challenge and acts as a major obstacle in developing scalable quantum information processors. Google’s Quantum {AI} and collaborators claimed to have conducted a supremacy regime experiment. In this experiment, a new two-qubit universal gate called {theSycamoregate} is constructed and employed to generate random quantum circuits ({RQCs}), using a programmable quantum processor with 53 qubits. These computations were carried out in a computational state space of size\$9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$9×1015. Nevertheless, even in strictly-controlled laboratory settings, quantum information on quantum processors is susceptible to various disturbances, including undesired interaction with the surroundings and imperfections in the quantum state. To address this issue, we conduct both quantum state tomography ({QST}) and quantum process tomography ({QPT}) experiments on Google’{sSycamoregate} using different artificial architectural superconducting quantum computer. Furthermore, to demonstrate how errors affect gate fidelity at the level of quantum circuits, we design and conduct full {QST} experiments for the five-qubit eight-cycle circuit, which was introduced as an example of the programability of Google’{sSycamorequantum} processor. These quantum tomography experiments are conducted in three distinct environments: noise-free, noisy simulation, and on {IBM} Quantum’s genuine quantum computer. Our results offer valuable insights into the performance of {IBM} Quantum’s hardware and the robustness {ofSycamoregates} within this experimental setup. These findings contribute to our understanding of quantum hardware performance and provide valuable information for optimizing quantum algorithms for practical applications.},

Owing to its hybrid architecture, circuit depth reduction capabilities, and hardware-efficient decomposition into only two {CNOT} gates, the {SQSCZ} gate holds strong potential for near-term quantum applications, including the Quantum Fourier Transform and Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for molecular simulations.

While the explainability of neural networks has been an active field of research in the last years, comparably little is known for quantum machine learning models. Despite a few recent works analyzing some specific aspects of explainability, as of now there is no clear big picture perspective as to what can be expected from quantum learning models in terms of explainability. In this work, we address this issue by identifying promising research avenues in this direction and lining out the expected future results. We additionally propose two explanation methods designed specifically for quantum machine learning models, as first of their kind to the best of our knowledge. Next to our pre-view of the field, we compare both existing and novel methods to explain the predictions of quantum learning models. By studying explainability in quantum machine learning, we can contribute to the sustainable development of the field, preventing trust issues in the future.},

But undesirable and ethically problematic consequences are possible too: biases and discrimination, breaches of privacy and security, and societal distortions such as unemployment, economic exploitation and weakened democratic processes. There is even a prospect, ultimately, of super-intelligent machines replacing humans. The key question, then, is: how can we benefit from {AI} while addressing its ethical problems? This book presents an innovative answer to the question by presenting a different perspective on {AI} and its ethical consequences. Instead of looking at individual {AI} techniques, applications or ethical issues, we can understand {AI} as a system of ecosystems, consisting of numerous interdependent technologies, applications and stakeholders. Developing this idea, the book explores how {AI} ecosystems can be shaped to foster human flourishing. Drawing on rich empirical insights and detailed conceptual analysis, it suggests practical measures to ensure that {AI} is used to make the world a better place},

We estimate the approximate cost of our construction using plausible physical assumptions for large-scale superconducting qubit platforms: a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity, a characteristic physical gate error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a reaction time of 10 microseconds. We account for factors that are normally ignored such as noise, the need to make repeated attempts, and the spacetime layout of the computation. When factoring 2048 bit {RSA} integers, our construction's spacetime volume is a hundredfold less than comparable estimates from earlier works (Van Meter et al. 2009, Jones et al. 2010, Fowler et al. 2012, Gheorghiu et al. 2019). In the abstract circuit model (which ignores overheads from distillation, routing, and error correction) our construction uses \$3 n + 0.002 n {\textbackslash}lg n\$ logical qubits, \$0.3 n{\textasciicircum}3 + 0.0005 n{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}lg n\$ Toffolis, and \$500 n{\textasciicircum}2 + n{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}lg n\$ measurement depth to factor \$n\$-bit {RSA} integers.

	abstract = {Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching ({MWPM}) decoding is important to quantum error correction decoding because of its accuracy. However, many believe that it is difficult, if possible at all, to achieve the microsecond latency requirement posed by superconducting qubits. This work presents the first publicly known {MWPM} decoder, called Micro Blossom, that achieves sub-microsecond decoding latency. Micro Blossom employs a heterogeneous architecture that carefully partitions a state-of-the-art {MWPM} decoder between software and a programmable accelerator with parallel processing units, one of each vertex/edge of the decoding graph. On a surface code with code distance \$d\$ and a circuit-level noise model with physical error rate \$p\$, Micro Blossom's accelerator employs \$O(d{\textasciicircum}3)\$ parallel processing units to reduce the worst-case latency from \$O(d{\textasciicircum}\{12\})\$ to \$O(d{\textasciicircum}9)\$ and reduce the average latency from \$O(p d{\textasciicircum}3+1)\$ to \$O(p{\textasciicircum}2 d{\textasciicircum}2+1)\$ when \$p {\textbackslash}ll 1\$. We report a prototype implementation of Micro Blossom using {FPGA}. Measured at \$d=13\$ and \$p=0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$, the prototype achieves an average decoding latency of \$0.8 {\textbackslash}mu s\$ at a moderate clock frequency of \$62 {MHz}\$. Micro Blossom is the first publicly known hardware-accelerated exact {MWPM} decoder, and the decoding latency of \$0.8 {\textbackslash}mu s\$ is 8 times shorter than the best latency of {MWPM} decoder implementations reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {We analyze surface codes, the topological quantum error-correcting codes introduced by Kitaev. In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z\_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

            As quantum technologies ({QT}) advance, their potential impact on and relation with society has been developing into an important issue for exploration. In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of {QT}, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the {QT} field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in {QT}. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in {QT} such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of {QT} are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that {QT} is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the {QT} field and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of {QT} explicit, can result in a better technology for society.},

	abstract = {{AbstractOver} the last two decades, computational methods have made tremendous advances, and today many key properties of lithium-ion batteries can be accurately predicted by first principles calculations. For this reason, computations have become a cornerstone of battery-related research by providing insight into fundamental processes that are not otherwise accessible, such as ionic diffusion mechanisms and electronic structure effects, as well as a quantitative comparison with experimental results. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ab initio approaches for the modelling of battery materials. We consider techniques for the computation of equilibrium cell voltages, 0-Kelvin and finite-temperature voltage profiles, ionic mobility and thermal and electrolyte stability. The strengths and weaknesses of different electronic structure methods, such as {DFT}+U and hybrid functionals, are discussed in the context of voltage and phase diagram predictions, and we review the merits of lattice models for the evaluation of finite-temperature thermodynamics and kinetics. With such a complete set of methods at hand, first principles calculations of ordered, crystalline solids, i.e., of most electrode materials and solid electrolytes, have become reliable and quantitative. However, the description of molecular materials and disordered or amorphous phases remains an important challenge. We highlight recent exciting progress in this area, especially regarding the modelling of organic electrolytes and solid–electrolyte interfaces.},

Although significant progress has been made in the quantum simulation of simple molecules, ab initio simulation of solid-state materials on quantum computers is still in its early stage, mostly owing to the fact that the system size quickly becomes prohibitively large when approaching the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we introduce an orbital-based multifragment approach on top of the periodic density matrix embedding theory, resulting in a significantly smaller problem size for the current near-term quantum computer. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method compared with the conventional methodologies and experiments on solid-state systems with complex electronic structures. These include spin-polarized states of a hydrogen chain (1D-H), the equation of state of a boron nitride layer (h-{BN}) as well as the magnetic ordering in nickel oxide ({NiO}), a prototypical strongly correlated solid. Our results suggest that quantum embedding combined with a chemically intuitive fragmentation can greatly advance quantum simulation of realistic materials, thereby paving the way for solving important yet classically hard industrial problems on near-term quantum devices.},

Since this process is spin-allowed, it can proceed on an ultrafast timescale of less than several picoseconds, outcompeting most other loss mechanisms and reaching quantitative yields approaching 200\%. Due to this high quantum efficiency, the singlet fission process shows promise as a means of reducing thermalization losses in photovoltaic cells. This would potentially allow for efficiency improvements beyond the thermodynamic limit in a single junction cell. Efforts to incorporate this process into solar photovoltaic cells have spanned a wide range of device structures over the past decade.

	abstract = {Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires quantum error correction ({QEC}), with most recent breakthrough demonstrations of {QEC} using the surface code. {QEC} codes use multiple noisy physical qubits to encode information in fewer logical qubits, enabling the identification of errors through a decoding process. This process increases the logical fidelity (or accuracy) making the computation more reliable. However, most fast (efficient runtime) decoders neglect important noise characteristics, thereby reducing their accuracy. In this work, we introduce decoders that are both fast and accurate, and can be used with a wide class of {QEC} codes including the surface code. Our decoders, named belief-matching and belief-find, exploit all noise information and thereby unlock higher accuracy demonstrations of {QEC}. Using the surface code threshold as a performance metric, we observe a threshold at 0.94{\textbackslash}\% error probability for our decoders, outperforming the 0.82{\textbackslash}\% threshold for a standard minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. We also tested our belief-matching decoders in a theoretical case study of codes tailored to a biased noise model. We find that the decoders led to a much higher threshold and lower qubit overhead in the tailored surface code with respect to the standard, square surface code. Surprisingly, in the well-below threshold regime, the rectangular surface code becomes more resource-efficient than the tailored surface code, due to a previously unnoticed phenomenon that we call "fragile boundaries". Our decoders outperform all other fast decoders in terms of threshold and accuracy, enabling better results in current quantum error correction experiments and opening up new areas for theoretical case studies.},

However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells.

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, {MPS}) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, {isoTNS}) tensor network methods2,3 break down.

	abstract = {Today, intelligent systems that offer artificial intelligence capabilities often rely on machine learning. Machine learning describes the capacity of systems to learn from problem-specific training data to automate the process of analytical model building and solve associated tasks. Deep learning is a machine learning concept based on artificial neural networks. For many applications, deep learning models outperform shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches. In this article, we summarize the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current intelligent systems. In particular, we provide a conceptual distinction between relevant terms and concepts, explain the process of automated analytical model building through machine learning and deep learning, and discuss the challenges that arise when implementing such intelligent systems in the field of electronic markets and networked business. These naturally go beyond technological aspects and highlight issues in human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence servitization.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to have substantial impact on the finance industry, as they will be able to solve certain problems considerably faster than the best known classical algorithms. In this article we describe such potential applications of quantum computing to finance, starting with the state-of-the-art and focusing in particular on recent works by the {QC} Ware team. We consider quantum speedups for Monte Carlo methods, portfolio optimization, and machine learning. For each application we describe the extent of quantum speedup possible and estimate the quantum resources required to achieve a practical speedup. The near-term relevance of these quantum finance algorithms varies widely across applications - some of them are heuristic algorithms designed to be amenable to near-term prototype quantum computers, while others are proven speedups which require larger-scale quantum computers to implement. We also describe powerful ways to bring these speedups closer to experimental feasibility - in particular describing lower depth algorithms for Monte Carlo methods and quantum machine learning, as well as quantum annealing heuristics for portfolio optimization. This article is targeted at financial professionals and no particular background in quantum computation is assumed.},

The quantum approach to finance can support this desire. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on how quantum computing can be used in finance. This research aims to expose an architecture of the state of the art in quantum finance. In terms of methodology, the {PSALSAR} framework was used to conduct this systematic literature review. The selection procedure followed the {PRISMA} guidelines and was applied in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) without time limit. In total, 94 out of 1646 articles were included for data extraction and assessment of content evaluation covering the period 2001–2023. The current review of quantum finance literature is structured around the following themes: journals, research methods, tested data series, research topics in quantum finance, and future research directions. Within the financial sector, quantum computing is used in three main areas: simulation, optimization, and machine learning. These areas are supported by algorithms that have been created in recent years. Finally, we propose to highlight the benefits and the applications of quantum finance and to stimulate the interest in the future prospects of the debates.},

We leverage this technique to give improved and simplified algorithms for many amplitude estimation tasks: we perform non-destructive estimation without any assumptions on the amplitude, develop an algorithm with improved performance in practice, present a new method for unbiased amplitude estimation, and finally give a simpler method for trading quantum circuit depth for more repetitions of short circuits.},

            We present a detailed study of portfolio optimization using different versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}). For a given list of assets, the portfolio optimization problem is formulated as quadratic binary optimization constrained on the number of assets contained in the portfolio. {QAOA} has been suggested as a possible candidate for solving this problem (and similar combinatorial optimization problems) more efficiently than classical computers in the case of a sufficiently large number of assets. However, the practical implementation of this algorithm requires a careful consideration of several technical issues, not all of which are discussed in the present literature. The present article intends to fill this gap and thereby provides the reader with a useful guide for applying {QAOA} to the portfolio optimization problem (and similar problems). In particular, we will discuss several possible choices of the variational form and of different classical algorithms for finding the corresponding optimized parameters. Viewing at the application of {QAOA} on error-prone {NISQ} hardware, we also analyse the influence of statistical sampling errors (due to a finite number of shots) and gate and readout errors (due to imperfect quantum hardware). Finally, we define a criterion for distinguishing between ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ instances of the portfolio optimization problem.},

Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks ({qGANs}) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions - implicitly given by data samples - into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the {qGAN} can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state.

	abstract = {Abstract 
            In finance, portfolio optimization aims at finding optimal investments maximizing a trade-off between return and risks, given some constraints. Classical formulations of this quadratic optimization problem have exact or heuristic solutions, but the complexity scales up as the market dimension increases. Recently, researchers are evaluating the possibility of facing the complexity scaling issue by employing quantum computing. In this paper, the problem is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver ({VQE}), which in principle is very efficient. The main outcome of this work consists of the definition of the best hyperparameters to set, in order to perform Portfolio Optimization by {VQE} on real quantum computers. In particular, a quite general formulation of the constrained quadratic problem is considered, which is translated into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization by the binary encoding of variables and by including constraints in the objective function. This is converted into a set of quantum operators (Ising Hamiltonian), whose minimum eigenvalue is found by {VQE} and corresponds to the optimal solution. In this work, different hyperparameters of the procedure are analyzed, including different ansatzes and optimization methods by means of experiments on both simulators and real quantum computers. Experiments show that there is a strong dependence of solutions quality on the sufficiently sized quantum computer and correct hyperparameters, and with the best choices, the quantum algorithm run on real quantum devices reaches solutions very close to the exact one, with a strong convergence rate towards the classical solution, even without error-mitigation techniques. Moreover, results obtained on different real quantum devices, for a small-sized example, show the relation between the quality of the solution and the dimension of the quantum processor. Evidences allow concluding which are the best ways to solve real Portfolio Optimization problems by {VQE} on quantum devices, and confirm the possibility to solve them with higher efficiency, with respect to existing methods, as soon as the size of quantum hardware will be sufficiently high.},

Among them, quantum machine learning is one of the most exciting applications of quantum computers. In this paper, we introduce q-means, a new quantum algorithm for clustering. It is a quantum version of a robust k-means algorithm, with similar convergence and precision guarantees. We also design a method to pick the initial centroids equivalent to the classical k-means++ method. Our algorithm provides currently an exponential speedup in the number of points of the dataset, compared to the classical k-means algorithm. We also detail the running time of q-means when applied to well-clusterable datasets. We provide a detailed runtime analysis and numerical simulations for specific datasets. Along with the algorithm, the theorems and tools introduced in this paper can be reused for various applications in quantum machine learning.},

In this direction, various types of quantum machine learning models have been introduced and studied extensively. Yet, our understanding of how these models compare, both mutually and to classical models, remains limited. In this work, we identify a constructive framework that captures all standard models based on parametrized quantum circuits: that of linear quantum models. In particular, we show using tools from quantum information theory how data re-uploading circuits, an apparent outlier of this framework, can be efficiently mapped into the simpler picture of linear models in quantum Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we analyze the experimentally-relevant resource requirements of these models in terms of qubit number and amount of data needed to learn. Based on recent results from classical machine learning, we prove that linear quantum models must utilize exponentially more qubits than data re-uploading models in order to solve certain learning tasks, while kernel methods additionally require exponentially more data points. Our results provide a more comprehensive view of quantum machine learning models as well as insights on the compatibility of different models with {NISQ} constraints.},

Machine learning describes the capacity of systems to learn from problem-specific training data to automate the process of analytical model building and solve associated tasks. Deep learning is a machine learning concept based on artificial neural networks. For many applications, deep learning models outperform shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches. In this article, we summarize the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current intelligent systems. In particular, we provide a conceptual distinction between relevant terms and concepts, explain the process of automated analytical model building through machine learning and deep learning, and discuss the challenges that arise when implementing such intelligent systems in the field of electronic markets and networked business. These naturally go beyond technological aspects and highlight issues in human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence servitization.},

	abstract = {Quantum phase estimation ({QPE}) is a key quantum algorithm, which has been widely studied as a method to perform chemistry and solid-state calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Recently, several authors have proposed statistical alternatives to {QPE} that have benefits on early fault-tolerant devices, including shorter circuits and better suitability for error-mitigation techniques. However, experimental investigations of the algorithm on real quantum processors are lacking. Here, we implement statistical phase estimation on Rigetti’s superconducting processors. Specifically, we use a modification of the Lin and Tong [{PRX} Quantum 3, 010318 (2022)] algorithm with the improved Fourier approximation of Wan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 030503 (2022)] and apply a variational-compilation technique to reduce the circuit depth. We then incorporate error-mitigation strategies including zero-noise extrapolation and readout-error mitigation with bit-flip averaging. We propose a new method to estimate energies from the statistical phase estimation data, which is found to improve the accuracy in the final energy estimates by 1–2 orders of magnitude with respect to prior theoretical bounds, reducing the cost of performing accurate phase-estimation calculations. We apply these methods to chemistry problems for active spaces up to four electrons in four orbitals, including the application of a quantum embedding method, and use them to correctly estimate energies within chemical precision. Our work demonstrates that statistical phase estimation has a natural resilience to noise, particularly after mitigating coherent errors, and can achieve far higher accuracy than suggested by previous analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable quantum algorithm for early fault-tolerant devices.},

We estimate the logical and physical resources required to use these protocols to calculate the ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis with error below 10−3 atomic units, in the presence of depolarizing logical errors. Accounting for the overhead of rotation synthesis and magic state distillation, we find that the total 𝑇-gate counts do not vary significantly among the {EFT} {QPE} protocols at fixed state overlap. In addition to reducing the number of ancilla qubits and circuit depth, the noise robustness of the {EFT} protocols can be leveraged to reduce resource requirements below those of textbook {QPE}, realizing an approximately 300-fold reduction in aggregate computational volume in some cases. We also compare resource requirements for {QPE} on Trotterized time evolution and qubitized walk operators, for this same minimal exemplar. We estimate the costs of these two approaches to be comparable, with the Trotter approach requiring slightly fewer physical qubits and the qubitized approach requiring slightly fewer code cycles. Even so, our estimates are well beyond the scale of existing early fault-tolerance demonstrations.},

This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid {ESMs} demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional {ESMs}. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + {AI}) {ESMs}, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in {ESMs} even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimisation problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in {ESMs}, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.},

            Using quantum technologies ({QTs}) to solve problems related to climate change is a key goal for many physicists at the research and development stage. Recent research anticipates numerous real-world applications for quantum technologies that will address climate change and further sustainable development goals. However, currently there is no guiding framework for implementing responsible, sustainable innovation, or criteria for evaluating the sustainability of {QTs}. The goal of this article is to augment previous responsible innovation ({RI}) analysis of, and recommendations for, quantum innovation by emphasizing sustainability as a key value. This article will also provide specific recommendations for developing sustainable {QTs} and criteria to assess the sustainability of {QTs}. With increases in funding for quantum innovation and the predicted operationality of many {QTs} in the coming decades, this is a key moment to discuss values and shape the quantum innovation trajectory. By using an {RI} approach with an added emphasis on sustainability, this article offers tools for developing responsible, sustainable {QTs} that are sensitive to the climate change context.},

            As quantum technologies ({QT}) advance, their potential impact on and relation with society has been developing into an important issue for exploration. In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of {QT}, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the {QT} field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in {QT}. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in {QT} such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of {QT} are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that {QT} is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the {QT} field and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of {QT} explicit, can result in a better technology for society.},

	abstract = {One of the main bottlenecks in the pursuit of a large-scale–chip-based quantum computer is the large number of control signals needed to operate qubit systems. As system sizes scale up, the number of terminals required to connect to off-chip control electronics quickly becomes unmanageable. Here, we discuss a quantum-dot spin-qubit architecture that integrates on-chip control electronics, allowing for a significant reduction in the number of signal connections at the chip boundary. By arranging the qubits in a two-dimensional array with about 12 𝜇⁢m pitch, we create space to implement locally integrated sample-and-hold circuits. This allows us to offset the inhomogeneities in the potential landscape across the array and to globally share the majority of the control signals for qubit operations. We make use of advanced circuit modeling software to go beyond conceptual drawings of the component layout, to assess the feasibility of the scheme through a concrete floor plan, including estimates of footprints for quantum and classical electronics, as well as routing of signal lines across the chip using different interconnect layers. We make use of local demultiplexing circuits to achieve an efficient signal-connection scaling, leading to a Rent’s exponent as low as 𝑝 =0.43. Furthermore, we use available data from state-of-the-art spin qubit and microelectronics technology development, as well as circuit models and simulations, to estimate the operation frequencies and power consumption of a million-qubit array. This work presents a complementary approach to previously proposed architectures, focusing on a feasible scheme to integrating quantum and classical hardware, and identifying remaining challenges for achieving full fault-tolerant quantum computation. It thereby significantly closes the gap towards a fully {CMOS}-compatible quantum computer implementation.},

By integrating tools like Quirk for circuit design and Docker containers for environment consistency, this tool enables developers to design quantum circuits, store them in databases, and execute them on various quantum platforms with minimal adjustments.

However, current methodologies employed in quantum computing often require, among other things, a broad understanding of quantum hardware and low-level programming languages, posing challenges to software developers in effectively creating and implementing quantum services. This study advocates the adoption of software engineering principles in quantum computing, thereby establishing a higher level of hardware abstraction that allows developers to focus on application development. With this proposal, developers can design and deploy quantum services with less effort, which is similar to the facilitation provided by service-oriented computing for the development of conventional software services. This study introduces a continuous deployment strategy adapted to the development of quantum services that covers the creation and deployment of such services. For this purpose, an extension of the {OpenAPI} specification is proposed, which allows the generation of services that implement quantum algorithms. The proposal was validated through the creation of an application programming interface with diverse quantum algorithm implementations and evaluated through a survey of various developers and students who were introduced to the tool with positive results.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by solving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also depends on simulations. Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such, simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different optimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different levels. This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Besides the optimizations that can be performed at the algorithmic level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimizations and future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and scalability of the simulations.},

A number of models of quantum computation exist, including the now well-studied quantum circuit model. Although these models have been shown to be formally equivalent, their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. The new paradigm of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state, is particularly exciting in this regard. In this article we discuss a number of recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation in both fundamental and practical issues, in particular regarding the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps toward experimental realization. Moreover, we highlight a number of surprising connections between this field and other branches of physics and mathematics.},

Historically, the study of quantum point defects has been limited to a relatively small set of host materials and defect systems. In this article, we consider the potential for identifying defects in new materials, either to advance known applications in quantum science or to enable entirely new capabilities. We propose that, in principle, it should be possible to reverse the historical approach, which is partially based on accidental discovery, in order to design quantum defects with desired properties suitable for specific applications.

We employ quantum defect embedding theory to translate the Hamiltonian of a defect-containing supercell into a smaller, effective Hamiltonian that accounts for dielectric screening effects. Our approach integrates block-encoding of the dipole operator with quantum phase estimation to selectively sample the optically active excited states that exhibit the largest dipole transition amplitudes.

	title = {Dynamische Manipulation von {NV}-Zentren im Diamant für Quantenoptik},
	url = {https://publica.fraunhofer.de/handle/publica/281667},
	doi = {10.6094/UNIFR/11479},
	abstract = {Die Aufgabe für die vorliegende Dissertation bestand darin, eine Technik zu entwickeln, die sowohl eine aktive Kontrolle als auch ein schnelles Schalten des Ladungszustandes eines einzelnen Stickstoff-Vakanz-Zentrums ({NV}-Zentrum) im Diamant ermöglicht. Insbesondere soll erstmals zwischen allen drei möglichen Ladungszuständen geschaltet werden können. Dies wäre ein entscheidender Schritt für eine Vielzahl quantenoptischer Anwendungen. Seit der Entdeckung des {NV}-Zentrums im Diamant in den 1970er Jahren erweckte dies wegen seiner hervorragenden spin-optischen Eigenschaften sehr großes Interesse in der quantenphysikalischen Forschung. Es ist inzwischen das bestuntersuchte Defektzentrum im Diamant. Dieses Defektzentrum kann einen positiven ({NV}+), einen neutralen ({NV}0) oder einen negativen ({NV}\&\#8722;) Ladungszustand annehmen. Im neutralen und negativen Zustand ist das Zentrum optisch aktiv und zeigt Eigenschaften eines Einzelphotonenemitters mit hoher Photostabilität. Der negative Zustand zeigt zusätzlich spin-optische Eigenschaften, die ihn für viele quantenphysikalische Anwendungen bei Raumtemperatur äußerst attraktiv machen. Der positive Zustand hingegen ist optisch nicht aktiv. Für viele quantenphysikalische Anwendungen sind oberflächennahe {NV}-Zentren eine Grundvoraussetzung, um beispielsweise in der Metrologie die Sensitivität zu erhöhen oder die emittierten Photonen effizient zu extrahieren. Allerdings beeinflussen Oberflächeneffekte den Ladungszustand des {NV}-Zentrums auf unkontrollierbare Weise. Dies macht eine aktive Stabilisierung seines Ladungszustands erforderlich. Neben einer aktiven Stabilisierung ist ein dynamisches Schalten zwischen den verschiedenen Ladungszuständen von großer Bedeutung. Wenn dies gelingt, könnten die spektralen Emissionseigenschaften eines Einzelphotonenemitters gesteuert und Quantencomputer sowie Quantenspeicher von hoher Güte realisiert werden. Außerdem würden hierdurch Anwendungen mit dem neutralen oder positiv geladenen {NV}-Zentrum ermöglicht. Anhand der besonderen quantenoptischen Eigenschaften des {NV}-Zentrums und der experimentellen Anforderungen für technologische Anwendungen ergaben sich folgende Ziele für die vorliegende Arbeit: {BL} Einfacher Herstellungsprozess {BL} Möglichkeit einer Integration in hybride Architekturen {BL} Zweidimensionale Struktur für eine leichtere Miniaturisierung {BL} Möglichkeit der individuellen Adressierbarkeit einzelner {NV}-Zentren {BL} Aktive Stabilisierung der Ladungszustände {NV}+, {NV}0 und {NV}\&\#8722; {BL} Aktives Schalten zwischen allen drei Ladungszuständen {NV}+, {NV}0 und {NV}\&\#8722; {BL} Schaltfrequenzen höher als die bisher erreichten 1MHz Um diese Ziele zu erreichen wurde eine zweidimensionale Al-Schottky-Diode aus Diamant entwickelt. Durch eine am Al-Gate anliegende Spannung konnte innerhalb der Löcherverarmungszone des Schottky-Übergangs die Ladungszustandsverteilung von {NV}-Ensembles bzw. der Ladungszustand eines einzelnen {NV}-Zentrums und somit ihre spektralen Emissionseigenschaften manipuliert werden. Insbesondere konnte ein einzelnes {NV}-Zentrum aktiv zwischen {NV}\&\#8722; und {NV}0 (optisch aktive Zustände) sowie {NV}+ (optisch nicht aktiver Zustand) geschaltet werden. Die Schaltfrequenzen betragen für den Übergang von {NV}\&\#8722;/{NV}0 nach {NV}+ bzw. von {NV}+ nach {NV}0/{NV}\&\#8722; ca. 100MHz bzw. 2 \&\#8722; 10MHz. Ein Vergleich mit bisher bekannten Technologien zeigt, dass die erreichten Frequenzen mehrere Größenordnungen höher sind und erstmals ein aktives Schalten zwischen allen drei Ladungszuständen ermöglicht wird. Mit Hilfe einer Simulation des zeitaufgelösten aktiven Schaltens von {NV}-Zentren konnte ein theoretisches Modell für den Mechanismus basierend auf dem Shockley-Read-Hall Effekt aufgestellt werden. Das {NV}-Zentrum wird durch eine Wechselwirkung mit dem zweidimensionalen Löcherkanal umgeladen. Der hierbei bestimmte Einfangquerschnitt für Löcher durch das {NV}-Zentrum beträgt zwischen 10\&\#8722;14 cm2 und 10\&\#8722;15 cm2. Diese zweidimensionale Al-Schottky-Diode aus Diamant kann für viele quantenoptische Anwendungen eingesetzt werden, die ein aktives und hochfrequentes Schalten des Ladungszustandes bzw. der spektralen Emissionseigenschaften von einzelnen {NV}-Zentren als Einzelphotonenemitter erfordern. Sie kann in elektronische Schaltkreise bzw. in hybride Architekturen integriert werden. Für die Realisierung eines Quantenregisters mit {NV}-Zentren können die Al-Gates derart strukturiert werden, dass einzelne Zentren separat adressiert werden. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnten alle oben formulierten experimentellen und technologischen Ziele für die aktive und hochfrequente Manipulation von einzelnen {NVZentren} umgesetzt werden. In den ersten beiden Kapiteln dieser Arbeit werden zunächst die wesentlichen Eigenschaften des Diamanten und des {NV}-Zentrums für quantenoptische Anwendungen sowie der Stand der Technik bezüglich einer aktiven Manipulation von {NV}-Zentren dargelegt. Daraus ergeben sich entsprechend die oben formulierten Ziele. Dann werden die gängigen Charakterisierungsmethoden wie das Konfokalmikroskop und das Hanbury-Brown und Twiss Interferometer vorgestellt. Im Anschluss daran geht es um die Abscheidung ultrareiner Diamantschichten, die Erzeugung von {NV}-Zentren ({NV}-Einzelzentren und {NV}-Ensembles) und die Herstellung der zweidimensionalen Al-Schottky-Diode aus Diamant. Schließlich werden die experimentellen Ergebnisse der aktiven Kontrolle und des dynamischen Schaltens von {NV}-Zentren präsentiert. Nach dem experimentellen Teil werden die Ergebnisse der Simulationen mit der Software {ATLAS} diskutiert und interpretiert, was zu einem vertieften Verständnis der Funktionsweise und der Mechanismen der planaren Diode und der {NV}-Manipulation führt. Am Ende dieser Arbeit werden die wesentlichen Ergebnisse zusammengefasst, die erreichten Ziele bewertet und die Anwendungsmöglichkeiten der zweidimensionalen Al-Schottky-Diode aus Diamant aufgezeigt.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy center (N-V center or {NV} center) is one of numerous photoluminescent point defects in diamond. Its most explored and useful properties include its spin-dependent photoluminescence (which enables measurement of the electronic spin state using optically detected magnetic resonance), and its relatively long spin coherence at room temperature, lasting up to milliseconds. The {NV} center energy levels are modified by magnetic fields, electric fields, temperature, and strain, which allow it to serve as a sensor of a variety of physical phenomena. Its atomic size and spin properties can form the basis for useful quantum sensors. 
{NV} centers enable nanoscale measurements of magnetic and electric fields, temperature, and mechanical strain with improved precision. External perturbation sensitivity makes {NV} centers ideal for applications in biomedicine—such as single-molecule imaging and cellular process modeling. {NV} centers can also be initialized as qubits and enable the implementation of quantum algorithms and networks. It has also been explored for applications in quantum computing (e.g. for entanglement generation), quantum simulation, and spintronics.},

	abstract = {The recent biotechnological progress has allowed life scientists and physicians to access an unprecedented, massive amount of data at all levels (molecular, supramolecular, cellular and so on) of biological complexity. So far, mostly classical computational efforts have been dedicated to the simulation, prediction or de novo design of biomolecules, in order to improve the understanding of their function or to develop novel therapeutics. At a higher level of complexity, the progress of omics disciplines (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) has prompted researchers to develop informatics means to describe and annotate new biomolecules identified with a resolution down to the single cell, but also with a high-throughput speed. Machine learning approaches have been implemented to both the modelling studies and the handling of biomedical data. Quantum computing ({QC}) approaches hold the promise to resolve, speed up or refine the analysis of a wide range of these computational problems. Here, we review and comment on recently developed {QC} algorithms for biocomputing, with a particular focus on multi-scale modelling and genomic analyses. Indeed, differently from other computational approaches such as protein structure prediction, these problems have been shown to be adequately mapped onto quantum architectures, the main limit for their immediate use being the number of qubits and decoherence effects in the available quantum machines. Possible advantages over the classical counterparts are highlighted, along with a description of some hybrid classical/quantum approaches, which could be the closest to be realistically applied in biocomputation.},

In this paper, we investigate the braiding dynamics of Majorana fermions on superconducting nanowires. In a finite-size system, a nonadiabatic dynamical process between nearly degenerate states dominates the braiding that operates qubits of Majorana fermions. Our simulations clarify how qubits behave in the real-time braiding process and elucidate the optimum superconducting nanowire conditions for efficient topological quantum operation.},

The junction is assumed to be biased by a small current and subjected to quasiparticle poisoning. We find that the presence of quasiparticles leads to a voltage signal from the Josephson junction that can be observed both in the trivial and in the topological phase. Quite remarkably, these voltage signatures are sufficiently different in the two phases such that they can serve as means to clearly distinguish between trivial Andreev and topological Majorana bound states in the system. Moreover, these voltage signatures, in the trivial and topological phase, would allow one to measure directly the quasiparticle poisoning rates and to test various approaches for protection against quasiparticle poisoning.},

Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits.

As a lightweight message-passing decoder, Relay-{BP} is inherently parallel, enabling rapid low-footprint decoding with {FPGA} or {ASIC} real-time implementations, similar to standard {BP}. A core aspect of our decoder is its enhancement of the standard {BP} algorithm by incorporating disordered memory strengths. This dampens oscillations and breaks symmetries that trap traditional {BP} algorithms. By dynamically adjusting memory strengths in a relay approach, Relay-{BP} can consecutively encounter multiple valid corrections to improve decoding accuracy.

	abstract = {Adaptation to climate change requires robust climate projections, yet the uncertainty in these projections performed by ensembles of Earth system models ({ESMs}) remains large. This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid {ESMs} demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional {ESMs}. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + {AI}) {ESMs}, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in {ESMs} even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimisation problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in {ESMs}, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.},

	abstract = {As quantum technologies ({QT}) advance, their potential impact on and relation with society has been developing into an important issue for exploration. In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of {QT}, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the {QT} field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in {QT}. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in {QT} such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of {QT} are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that {QT} is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the {QT} field, and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of {QT} explicit, can result in a better technology for society.},

Therefore, finding a method to reduce the number of parameters has become crucial for achieving efficient training. This work proposes a training scheme for classical neural networks ({NNs}) that utilizes the exponentially large Hilbert space of a quantum system. By mapping a classical {NN} with \$M\$ parameters to a quantum neural network ({QNN}) with \$O({\textbackslash}text\{polylog\} (M))\$ rotational gate angles, we can significantly reduce the number of parameters. These gate angles can be updated to train the classical {NN}. Unlike existing quantum machine learning ({QML}) methods, the results obtained from quantum computers using our approach can be directly used on classical computers. Numerical results on the {MNIST} and Iris datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we investigate the effects of deeper {QNNs} and the number of measurement shots for the {QNN}, followed by the theoretical perspective of the proposed method.

This compatibility, however, can have varying degrees ranging from the mere ability to fabricate qubits using a silicon wafer as a substrate, all the way to the co-integration of qubits with high-yield, low-power advanced electronics to control these qubits.

One such problem is the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a magnetic spin system quenched through a quantum phase transition. State-of-the-art classical simulations demand resources that grow exponentially with system size. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench in two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for classical approaches. We assess approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks and conclude that no known approach can achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe.

	abstract = {The discovery of small molecules with therapeutic potential is a long-standing challenge in chemistry and biology. Researchers have increasingly leveraged novel computational techniques to streamline the drug development process to increase hit rates and reduce the costs associated with bringing a drug to market. To this end, we introduce a quantum-classical generative model that seamlessly integrates the computational power of quantum algorithms trained on a 16-qubit {IBM} quantum computer with the established reliability of classical methods for designing small molecules. Our hybrid generative model was applied to designing new {KRAS} inhibitors, a crucial target in cancer therapy. We synthesized 15 promising molecules during our investigation and subjected them to experimental testing to assess their ability to engage with the target. Notably, among these candidates, two molecules, {ISM}061-018-2 and {ISM}061-22, each featuring unique scaffolds, stood out by demonstrating effective engagement with {KRAS}. {ISM}061-018-2 was identified as a broad-spectrum {KRAS} inhibitor, exhibiting a binding affinity to {KRAS}-G12D at \$1.4 {\textbackslash}mu M\$. Concurrently, {ISM}061-22 exhibited specific mutant selectivity, displaying heightened activity against {KRAS} G12R and Q61H mutants. To our knowledge, this work shows for the first time the use of a quantum-generative model to yield experimentally confirmed biological hits, showcasing the practical potential of quantum-assisted drug discovery to produce viable therapeutics. Moreover, our findings reveal that the efficacy of distribution learning correlates with the number of qubits utilized, underlining the scalability potential of quantum computing resources.

	abstract = {Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to traditional computing. It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succinct expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q\#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms. Q\# provides a type system, a tightly constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax, symbolic code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations, and powerful functional constructs which aid composition.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is the latest revolution in computing and will probably come to be seen as an advance as important as the steam engine or the information society. In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} Second Quantum Revolution facilitates the engineering of new classes of sensors, communication technologies, and computers with unprecedented capabilities. Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focused on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market.In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: The promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts.Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs.This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the {CEN}-{CENELEC} Focus Group on Quantum Technologies ({FGQT}), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.},

Quantum computers promise efficient chemical simulation, but the existing quantum algorithms require many logical qubits and gates, placing practical applications beyond existing technology. Here, we carry out the first quantum simulations of chemical dynamics by employing a more hardware-efficient encoding scheme that uses both qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom. Our trapped-ion device accurately simulates the dynamics of non-adiabatic chemical processes, which are among the most difficult problems in computational chemistry because they involve strong coupling between electronic and nuclear motions. We demonstrate the programmability and versatility of our approach by simulating the dynamics of three different molecules as well as open-system dynamics in the condensed phase, all with the same quantum resources. Our approach requires orders of magnitude fewer resources than equivalent qubit-only quantum simulations, demonstrating the potential of using hybrid encoding schemes to accelerate quantum simulations of complex chemical processes, which could have applications in fields ranging from energy conversion and storage to biology and drug design.},

This objective is generally reflected in numerous policy documents and crystallised in the Digital Decade Policy Programme, which sets specific targets to achieve it. The {EU} policy documents recognise a world-changing potential of quantum technologies whilst remaining vigilant due to their potential disruptive impact. This white paper maps the way the ambition of digital sovereignty is interwoven with the development of quantum technologies in the {EU} digital policy and legislation. It documents empirical work, identifying thirty policy and legal documents which were produced during the past five years and bind digital sovereignty and quantum technologies together. The aim of this white paper is to bring attention to and invite further examination of the complex interrelation between digital sovereignty and quantum innovation. In this way, the white paper wishes to spark a broader conversation on the feasibility and desirability of emerging and future tech governance approaches.},

            Using quantum technologies ({QTs}) to solve problems related to climate change is a key goal for many physicists at the research and development stage. Recent research anticipates numerous real-world applications for quantum technologies that will address climate change and further sustainable development goals. However, currently there is no guiding framework for implementing responsible, sustainable innovation, or criteria for evaluating the sustainability of {QTs}. The goal of this article is to augment previous responsible innovation ({RI}) analysis of, and recommendations for, quantum innovation by emphasizing sustainability as a key value. This article will also provide specific recommendations for developing sustainable {QTs} and criteria to assess the sustainability of {QTs}. With increases in funding for quantum innovation and the predicted operationality of many {QTs} in the coming decades, this is a key moment to discuss values and shape the quantum innovation trajectory. By using an {RI} approach with an added emphasis on sustainability, this article offers tools for developing responsible, sustainable {QTs} that are sensitive to the climate change context.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} trajectory surface hopping ({TSH}) method is a general methodology for dynamics propagation of nonadiabatic systems. It is based on the hypothesis that the time evolution of a wave packet through a potential‐energy branching region can be approximated by an ensemble of independent semiclassical trajectories stochastically distributed among the branched surfaces. As it was proposed about 40 years ago, the {TSH} methodology has become one of the main tools for nonadiabatic dynamics propagation in molecular physics and chemistry. One reason for this success lies on its intuitive conceptual background allied to its high computational efficiency when compared to full quantum mechanical propagation. In this work, the {TSH} method is reviewed and applications from different fields are surveyed. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. {WIREs} Comput Mol Sci 2011 1 620–633 {DOI}: 10.1002/wcms.64This article is categorized under:Theoretical and Physical Chemistry {\textgreater} Reaction Dynamics and Kinetics},

Building large, useful quantum systems based on transmon qubits will require significant improvements in qubit relaxation and coherence times, which are orders of magnitude shorter than limits imposed by bulk properties of the constituent materials. This indicates that relaxation likely originates from uncontrolled surfaces, interfaces, and contaminants. Previous efforts to improve qubit lifetimes have focused primarily on designs that minimize contributions from surfaces. However, significant improvements in the lifetime of two-dimensional transmon qubits have remained elusive for several years. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional transmon qubits that have both lifetimes and coherence times with dynamical decoupling exceeding 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device. We have observed increased lifetimes for seventeen devices, indicating that these material improvements are robust, paving the way for higher gate fidelities in multi-qubit processors.},

By using a dry etching process, we obtained transmon qubits with a best T1 lifetime of 503 μs. As a comparison, we also fabricated transmon qubits with other popular materials, including niobium and aluminum, under the same design and fabrication processes. After characterizing their coherence properties, we found that qubits prepared with tantalum films have the best performance. Since the dry etching process is stable and highly anisotropic, it is much more suitable for fabricating complex scalable quantum circuits, when compared to wet etching. As a result, the current breakthrough indicates that the dry etching process of tantalum film is a promising approach to fabricate medium- or large-scale superconducting quantum circuits with a much longer lifetime, meeting the requirements for building practical quantum computers.},

            The Second Quantum Revolution facilitates the engineering of new classes of sensors, communication technologies, and computers with unprecedented capabilities. Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focused on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. 
            In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: The promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. 
            Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs. 
            This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the {CEN}-{CENELEC} Focus Group on Quantum Technologies ({FGQT}), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.},

	abstract = {Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10−6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10−7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

            Quantum machine learning is often highlighted as one of the most promising practical applications for which quantum computers could provide a computational advantage. However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of quantum machine learning models in practice is that these models, even once trained, still require access to a quantum computer in order to be evaluated on new data. To solve this issue, we introduce a class of quantum models where quantum resources are only required during training, while the deployment of the trained model is classical. Specifically, the training phase of our models ends with the generation of a ‘shadow model’ from which the classical deployment becomes possible. We prove that: (i) this class of models is universal for classically-deployed quantum machine learning; (ii) it does have restricted learning capacities compared to ‘fully quantum’ models, but nonetheless (iii) it achieves a provable learning advantage over fully classical learners, contingent on widely believed assumptions in complexity theory. These results provide compelling evidence that quantum machine learning can confer learning advantages across a substantially broader range of scenarios, where quantum computers are exclusively employed during the training phase. By enabling classical deployment, our approach facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning models in various practical contexts.},

Quantum computing is considered a promising technology for designing new materials that can solve these problems. The purpose of the study is to examine the potential application of quantum computing in the design of battery materials that are more efficient and have better stability. The method used is a quantum simulation to model the interactions of atoms and molecules in various materials that have the potential to be used for batteries, such as lithium-sulfur, graphene, and sodium-ion. The results showed that lithium-sulfur-based materials have a high energy capacity but are less stable, while graphene is more stable with excellent conductivity despite a slightly lower energy capacity. These results provide new insights into the selection of battery materials based on the balance between energy capacity, conductivity, and thermal stability. The conclusion of this study confirms the importance of quantum computing in accelerating the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly battery materials, although further physical experiments are needed to verify the results of quantum simulations.

However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 109 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of physical errors1–3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7\% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7–10 that for 20 years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with {CNOT} gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1\%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models ({DDPMs}) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model ({QuDDPM}) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. {QuDDPM} adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate {QuDDPM}'s capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.},

However, the creation of successful business in the field is challenging owing to the required extensive investments into postdoctoral-level workforce and sophisticated infrastructure without an existing market that can financially support these operations.This commentary paper reviews the recent efforts taken in the {EU} to foster the quantum-computing ecosystem together with its current status. Importantly, we propose concrete actions for the {EU} to take to enable future growth of this field towards the desired goals. In particular, we suggest ways to enable the creation of {EU}-based quantum-computing unicorns which may act as key crystallization points of quantum technology and its commercialization. These unicorns may provide stability to the otherwise scattered ecosystem, thus pushing forward global policies enabling the global spread of {EU} innovations and technologies.The unicorns may act as a conduit, through which the {EU}-based quantum ecosystem can stand out from similar ecosystems based in Asia and the United States. Such strong companies are required because of the level of investment currently required in the marketplace. This paper suggests methodologies and best practices that can enhance the probability of the creation of the unicorns.Furthermore, we explore future scenarios, in which the unicorns can operate from the {EU} and to support the {EU} quantum ecosystem. This exploration is conducted focusing on the steps to be taken and on the impact the companies may have in our opinion.},

	abstract = {The ambition of harnessing the quantum for computation is at odds with the fundamental phenomenon of decoherence. The purpose of quantum error correction ({QEC}) is to counteract the natural tendency of a complex system to decohere. This cooperative process, which requires participation of multiple quantum and classical components, creates a special type of dissipation that removes the entropy caused by the errors faster than the rate at which these errors corrupt the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such a process faced an excessive generation of errors that overwhelmed the error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically possible to utilize {QEC} for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open question. We answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected logical qubit whose quantum coherence is significantly longer than that of all the imperfect quantum components involved in the {QEC} process, beating the best of them with a coherence gain of \$G = 2.27 {\textbackslash}pm 0.07\$. We achieve this performance by combining innovations in several domains including the fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits and model-free reinforcement learning.},

This work proposes a general approach to constructing accurate {MLFFs} for large-scale molecular simulations ({GEMS}) by training on “bottom-up” and “top-down” molecular fragments, from which the relevant interactions can be learned. {GEMS} allows nanosecond-scale {MD} simulations of {\textgreater}25,000 atoms at essentially ab initio quality, correctly predicts dynamical oscillations between different helical motifs in polyalanine, and yields good agreement with terahertz vibrational spectroscopy for large-scale protein-water fluctuations in solvated crambin.

In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2–4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes ({MZMs}). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6–11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12–14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 {fF}. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1\%.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} digital transformation of the economy is accelerating companies’ engagement in information technology ({IT}) innovation. To anticipate which technologies will become relevant over time and integrate them in their innovation plans, companies often rely on product roadmaps as strategic tools. However, ethical issues resulting from ubiquitous {IT} use have shown the need to accommodate hyped technical advancements in information systems ({IS}) design and acknowledge human values with moral relevance. Scholars have argued that this moral relevance can only come from an ethical framework. The empirical study presented here investigates whether the three ethical theories of utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and deontology can complement traditional innovation planning approaches. The mixed-method study covers three {IT} products – a digital toy, a food-delivery app and a telemedicine system. The results reveal that the three ethical theories boost creativity around values and enrich {IT} innovation planning by supporting the acknowledgment of more and higher value principles (e.g., freedom or personal growth), more diverse value classes (e.g., individual and social values) as well as more original values (e.g., human contact) in system design. What is more, participants identify and mitigate potential social and ethical issues associated with the {IT} product. Against this background, the findings in this paper suggest that a “value-based roadmapping” approach could be a vital stimulus for future {IT} innovation planning.},

	abstract = {Abstract          The term ‘ethical risk’ often appears in discussions about the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence ({AI}). However, ethical risk remains inconsistently defined in this context, obscuring what distinguishes it from other forms of risk, such as social, reputational or legal risk, for example. In this paper we present a definition of ethical risk for {AI} as being any risk associated with an {AI} that may cause stakeholders to fail one or more of their ethical responsibilities towards other stakeholders. To support our definition, we describe how stakeholders have role responsibilities that follow from their relationship with the {AI}, and that these responsibilities are towards other stakeholders associated with the {AI}. We discuss how stakeholders may differ in their ability to make decisions about an {AI}, their exposure to risk, and whether they or others may benefit from these risks. Stakeholders without the ability to make decisions about the risks associated with an {AI} and how it is used are dependent on other stakeholders with this ability. This relationship places those who depend on decision-making stakeholders at ethical risk of being dominated by them. The decision-making stakeholder is ethically responsible for the risks their decisions about the {AI} impose on those affected by them. We illustrate our account of ethical risk for {AI} with two examples: {AI}-designed attachments for surgical robots that are optimised for treating specific patients, and self-driving ‘robotaxis’ that carry passengers on public roads.},

              Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction
              1,2
              offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10
              −6
              logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10
              −7
              excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

This work studies the behavior of {EQNN} models in the presence of noise. We show that certain {EQNN} models can preserve equivariance under Pauli channels, while this is not possible under the amplitude damping channel. We claim that the symmetry breaks linearly in the number of layers and noise strength. We support our claims with numerical data from simulations as well as hardware up to 64 qubits. Furthermore, we provide strategies to enhance the symmetry protection of {EQNN} models in the presence of noise.

	abstract = {Quantum physics has changed the way we understand our environment, and one of its branches, quantum mechanics, has demonstrated accurate and consistent theoretical results. Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These advantages are achieved through the use of quantum features, such as entanglement or superposition. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, scientific challenges are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity (more bytes than atoms in the observable universe) or the time it would take (thousands of years), and quantum computation is the only known answer. However, current quantum devices do not have yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning, finance, or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a review of the literature published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze, and classify the different types of algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. The methodology follows the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Review methods, such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the software engineering field. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms and shows their implementation using computational quantum circuits or ansatzs. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. One of the most relevant applications in the machine learning field is image classification. Many articles, especially within the classification, try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in quantum hardware is required for this potential to be achieved since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.},

            Quantum machine learning models have shown successful generalization performance even when trained with few data. In this work, through systematic randomization experiments, we show that traditional approaches to understanding generalization fail to explain the behavior of such quantum models. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art quantum neural networks accurately fit random states and random labeling of training data. This ability to memorize random data defies current notions of small generalization error, problematizing approaches that build on complexity measures such as the {VC} dimension, the Rademacher complexity, and all their uniform relatives. We complement our empirical results with a theoretical construction showing that quantum neural networks can fit arbitrary labels to quantum states, hinting at their memorization ability. Our results do not preclude the possibility of good generalization with few training data but rather rule out any possible guarantees based only on the properties of the model family. These findings expose a fundamental challenge in the conventional understanding of generalization in quantum machine learning and highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the study of quantum models for machine learning tasks.},

While existing {QRL} methods have shown success in discrete action spaces, extending these techniques to continuous domains is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality introduced by discretization. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a quantum Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ({DDPG}) algorithm that efficiently addresses both classical and quantum sequential decision problems in continuous action spaces. Moreover, our approach facilitates single-shot quantum state generation: a one-time optimization produces a model that outputs the control sequence required to drive a fixed initial state to any desired target state. In contrast, conventional quantum control methods demand separate optimization for each target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and discuss its potential applications in quantum control.},

	abstract = {Quantum support vector machines employ quantum circuits to define the kernel function. It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in \$O(M{\textasciicircum}\{4.67\}/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}2)\$ quantum circuit evaluations, where \$M\$ denotes the size of the data set and \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ the solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values, which is only obtainable in theory. We prove under an empirically motivated assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in \$O({\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ M{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}6, {\textbackslash}, 1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{10\} {\textbackslash}\})\$ evaluations by employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos. Accompanying empirical results demonstrate these analytical complexities to be essentially tight. In addition, we investigate a variational approximation to quantum support vector machines and show that their heuristic training achieves considerably better scaling in our experiments.},

Hence our research is focused to examine the execution speed and accuracy of quantum support vector machines classification compared to classical {SVM} classification by proper quantum feature mapping selection. As the size of the dataset becomes complex, a proper feature map has to be selected to outperform or equally perform the classification. Hence the paper focuses on the selection of the best feature map for some benchmark datasets. Additionally experimental results show that the processing time of the algorithm is considerably reduced concerning classical machine learning.

Recent advances in structural modeling driven by deep learning have achieved unprecedented success at predicting a protein’s crystal structure, but it is not clear if these models are learning the physics of how proteins dynamically fold into their equilibrium structure or are just accurate knowledge-based predictors of the final state. Results. In this work, we compare the pathways generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods to experimental data about protein folding pathways. The methods considered were {AlphaFold} 2, {RoseTTAFold}, {trRosetta}, {RaptorX}, {DMPfold}, {EVfold}, {SAINT}2 and Rosetta. We find evidence that their simulated dynamics capture some information about the folding pathway, but their predictive ability is worse than a trivial classifier using sequence-agnostic features like chain length. The folding trajectories produced are also uncorrelated with experimental observables such as intermediate structures and the folding rate constant. These results suggest that recent advances in structure prediction do not yet provide an enhanced understanding of protein folding.Availability.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Exchange-only ({EO}) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for engineering scalable device layouts. The study of two-{EO}-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for , ,

              , leakage-controlled , and leakage-controlled  two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43\% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on postoperation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a  operation with minimal additional cost over a standard . We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum-dot architectures.

	abstract = {Photons have been a ﬂagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefﬁcient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more—have solidiﬁed it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a ﬂyover of some key aspects of the ﬁeld, with a focus on experiment.

            Quantum computers have made extraordinary progress over the past decade, and significant milestones have been achieved along the path of pursuing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. Quantum advantage, the tipping point heralding the quantum era, has been accomplished along with several waves of breakthroughs. Quantum hardware has become more integrated and architectural compared to its toddler days. The controlling precision of various physical systems is pushed beyond the fault-tolerant threshold. Meanwhile, quantum computation research has established a new norm by embracing industrialization and commercialization. The joint power of governments, private investors, and tech companies has significantly shaped a new vibrant environment that accelerates the development of this field, now at the beginning of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we first discuss the progress achieved in the field of quantum computation by reviewing the most important algorithms and advances in the most promising technical routes, and then summarizing the next-stage challenges. Furthermore, we illustrate our confidence that solid foundations have been built for the fault-tolerant quantum computer and our optimism that the emergence of quantum killer applications essential for human society shall happen in the future.},

	abstract = {Photons as quantum bits have been amongst the first physical systems to be used for experimentally demonstrating some of the basic concepts in quantum computing starting from entanglement, to teleportation, to the realisation of a two-qubit {CNOT} gate and more recently for demonstrating quantum advantage using light. Photons can thus be used as qubits and are a potential platform for a future quantum computer. It is hard to predict which platform will win the race, perhaps none of them will surpass the others. What is for sure is that light can not be ignored altogether as this is the building block for communications and for propagating information in general, and thus for quantum information, in particular over long distances through optical fibres or via satellites. We will first develop what are the different ways of encoding qubits with photons and why photons are interesting systems with a great potential. We will then review some of the pioneering works up to what has been achieved more recently and we will conclude by what perspectives one can hope for using photonic qubits. Implicitly, in this work, we take the stand-point of a future fault-tolerant quantum computer using photons. In this review, some of the experimental technologies will be mentioned and briefly described but the reader will refer to further readings for more information onto how to produce, control and detect photonic qubits.

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography ({PET}) is considered an important and powerful tool for molecular imaging and medical diagnosis with its high sensitivity. Further, single-photon emission {CT} ({SPECT}) is another important imaging modality providing different types of information in medical diagnosis. On the other hand, Compton imaging is a promising technique for future molecular imaging with multi-nuclides based on Compton scattering kinetics. In this regard, previously, we have developed gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet ({GAGG})scintillation-based {PET} systems and {GAGG}-scintillation-based Compton imaging systems for environmental applications. Here, we propose and develop a novel {PET}–Compton hybrid simultaneous imager based on a two-layer structure using thin scatterers and thick absorbers for multi-nuclide imaging, for e.g., simultaneous imaging of {PET} and {SPECT} tracers such as 18F-{FDG} and 111In, respectively. For achieving good spatial resolution of the Compton imager, the energy resolution of the utilized scintillators forms one of the most important characteristics. In this regard, {GAGG} is a promising scintillator because of its high light yield of over 50 000 photon/{MeV} and excellent energy resolution of 4\% with no background radiation and moderate decay time. In this study, we present the development of a simultaneous {PET}–Compton detector that consists of an 8 × 8 multipixel photon counter/{SiPM} ({MPPC}) array individually coupled with a 2.5 × 2.5 × 9-mm3 Ce:Gd3Ga2.7Al2.3O12 scintillators (absorbers) for proof of concept of simultaneous {PET} and {SPECT} imaging. The pixel size of the {MPPC} is 3 mm × 3 mm, and it is operated at 55 V at room temperature. The signals from the {MPPC} scintillators are individually amplified and converted with a dynamic time over threshold ({dTOT}) circuit to record the energy and timing information. In image reconstruction, the data acquired with the use of the developed modules are classified into events of either Compton imaging or {PET} imaging by coincidence detection between scatterer and absorber or between absorber and absorber, respectively. The coincidence events between absorber and absorber are regarded as {PET} annihilation-gamma events and those between scatterer and absorber are used as Compton imaging events. In our experiment, images of 111In and 18F-{FDG}, which are used as multi-nuclide tracers, are acquired simultaneously using the developed detector for Compton imaging and {PET} imaging. We believe that our approach is a significant step forward for medical imaging and related fields.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances may lead to the development of small-scale quantum computers that are capable of solving problems that cannot be tackled with classical computers. A limited number of algorithms have been proposed and their relevance to real-world problems is a subject of active investigation. Analysis of many-body quantum systems is particularly challenging for classical computers due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles. Hence, solving the problems relevant to chemistry and condensed-matter physics is expected to be the first successful application of quantum computers. In this Article, we propose another class of problems from the quantum realm that can be solved efficiently on quantum computers: model inference for nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy, which is important for biological and medical research. Our results are based on three interconnected studies. First, we use methods from classical machine learning to analyse a dataset of {NMR} spectra of small molecules. We perform stochastic neighbourhood embedding and identify clusters of spectra, and demonstrate that these clusters are correlated with the covalent structure of the molecules. Second, we propose a simple and efficient method, aided by a quantum simulator, to extract the {NMR} spectrum of any hypothetical molecule described by a parametric Heisenberg model. Third, we propose a simple variational Bayesian inference procedure for estimating the Hamiltonian parameters of experimentally relevant {NMR} spectra.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Velocity Jumps approach, denoted as {JUMP}, a new class of Molecular dynamics integrators, replacing the Langevin dynamics by a hybrid model combining a classical Langevin diffusion and a piecewise deterministic Markov process, where the expensive computation of long-range pairwise interactions is replaced by a resampling of the velocities at random times. This framework allows for an acceleration in the simulation speed while preserving sampling and dynamical properties such as the diffusion constant. It can also be integrated in classical multi-timestep methods, pushing further the computational speedup, while avoiding some of the resonance issues of the latter thanks to the random nature of jumps. The {JUMP}, {JUMP}-{RESPA} and {JUMP}-{RESPA}1 integrators have been implemented in the {GPU}-accelerated version of the Tinker-{HP} package and are shown to provide significantly enhanced performances compared to their {BAOAB}, {BAOAB}-{RESPA} and {BAOAB}-{RESPA}1 counterparts respectively.},

Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply {TFQ} to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, layerwise learning, Hamiltonian learning, sampling thermal states, variational quantum eigensolvers, classification of quantum phase transitions, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning.

This survey paper presents the first systematic analysis of the various capabilities of quantum computing in enhancing healthcare systems, with a focus on its potential to revolutionize compute-intensive healthcare tasks such as drug discovery, personalized medicine, {DNA} sequencing, medical imaging, and operational optimization. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we have developed taxonomies across different dimensions, including background and enabling technologies, applications, requirements, architectures, security, open issues, and future research directions, providing a panoramic view of the quantum computing paradigm for healthcare. Our survey aims to aid both new and experienced researchers in quantum computing and healthcare by helping them understand the current research landscape, identifying potential opportunities and challenges, and making informed decisions when designing new architectures and applications for quantum computing in healthcare.},

The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the {SLR} indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this {SLR} can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing holds great promise for solving complex problems that classical computing cannot address, with applications in various industries and sectors. However, developing efficient quantum software remains a challenge. Quantum software engineering ({QSE}) has emerged to address this, adapting classical software engineering practices for quantum systems. Design patterns, widely used in classical software, can provide reusable solutions for common quantum development issues, but their use in quantum software remains underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the use of design patterns in 2610 Qiskit programs from {GitHub}. Using the {QCPD} Tool to detect four design patterns (initialization, superposition, entanglement, and oracle) and {QMetrics} to compute software metrics, the study creates a dataset linking patterns with code characteristics. Three research questions guide the study: {RQ}1 examines the prevalence of design patterns in quantum software, {RQ}2 explores the relationship between design patterns and code metrics, and {RQ}3 analyzes the combinations of patterns that occur together. The findings provide insights into quantum software development, offering developers practical guidance on applying specific patterns. The results contribute to {QSE} by revealing key relationships between patterns and metrics, which can inform future research and tool development. These findings support improved performance, maintainability, and scalability, fostering the broader adoption of quantum computing.},

By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry such as the electronic structure of molecules.

As a result, developments that enable these problems to be tackled with fewer quantum resources should be considered important. Driven by this potential utility, quantum computational chemistry is rapidly emerging as an interdisciplinary field requiring knowledge of both quantum computing and computational chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to both computational chemistry and quantum computing, bridging the current knowledge gap. Major developments in this area are reviewed, with a particular focus on near-term quantum computation.

In this work, we explore the potential of quantum computing to solve a simplified version of protein folding. More precisely, we numerically investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}) in sampling low-energy conformations of short peptides. We start by benchmarking the algorithm on an even simpler problem: sampling self-avoiding walks. Motivated by promising results, we then apply the algorithm to a more complete version of protein folding, including a simplified physical potential. In this case, we find less promising results: deep quantum circuits are required to achieve accurate results, and the performance of {QAOA} can be matched by random sampling up to a small overhead. Overall, these results cast serious doubt on the ability of {QAOA} to address the protein folding problem in the near term, even in an extremely simplified setting.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has been proven to excel in factorization issues and unordered search problems due to its capability of quantum parallelism. This unique feature allows exponential speed-up in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) and Quantum {SVM} ({QSVM}) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the {QSVM} algorithm outperforms classical {SVM} on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models. Moving forward, more efforts are needed to explore new quantum learning models that can leverage the power of quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of classical machine learning.},

            Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional investigations by developing a hybrid quantum computing pipeline tailored to address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the application of quantum computation in drug discovery and propels it towards more scalable system. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug design workflows.},

Limited by the heat load of cabling and the massive cost of electronics, such an architecture is not viable for millions of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Monolithic integration of the control electronics and the qubits provides a promising solution, which, however, requires a coherent cryogenic microwave pulse generator that is compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we report such a signal source driven by digital-like signals, generating pulsed microwave emission with well-controlled phase, intensity, and frequency directly at millikelvin temperatures. We showcase high-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits with the microwave pulse generator. The device demonstrated here has a small footprint, negligible heat load, great flexibility to operate, and is fully compatible with today’s superconducting quantum circuits, thus providing an enabling technology for large-scale superconducting quantum computers., Integrating a control interface with a quantum processor as the number of qubits scales is a significant challenge.

Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules1–5. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits6–11, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement12,13. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit {iSWAP} gate using individually trapped X1Σ+ {NaCs} molecules. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 μs at a distance of 1.9 μm, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)\% in trials in which both molecules are present. Using motion–rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an {iSWAP} gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table.},

However, there are notably no strong theoretical insights about what makes a quantum circuit design better than another, and comparative studies between quantum equivalents have not been done for every type of classical layers or techniques crucial for classical machine learning. Particularly, the pooling layer within convolutional neural networks is a fundamental operation left to explore. Pooling mechanisms significantly improve the performance of classical machine learning algorithms by playing a key role in reducing input dimensionality and extracting clean features from the input data. In this work, an in-depth study of pooling techniques in hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks ({QCCNNs}) for classifying 2D medical images is performed. The performance of four different quantum and hybrid pooling techniques is studied: mid-circuit measurements, ancilla qubits with controlled gates, modular quantum pooling blocks and qubit selection with classical postprocessing. We find similar or better performance in comparison to an equivalent classical model and {QCCNN} without pooling and conclude that it is promising to study architectural choices in {QCCNNs} in more depth for future applications.},

It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

              Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction
              1,2
              offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10
              −6
              logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10
              −7
              excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking is a critical process for drug discovery and challenging due to the complexity and size of biomolecular systems, where the optimal binding configuration of a drug to a target protein is determined. Hybrid classical-quantum computing techniques offer a novel approach to address these challenges. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}) and its variations are hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and a promising tool for combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper presents a Digitized Counterdiabatic {QAOA} ({DC}-{QAOA}) approach to molecular docking. Simulated quantum runs were conducted on a {GPU} cluster. We examined 14 and 17 nodes instances - to the best of our knowledge the biggest published instance is 12-node at Ding et al. and we present the results. Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been increasingly utilized in the field of biomedical research to accelerate the drug discovery process. In recent years, the emergence of quantum computing has been followed by extensive exploration of quantum machine learning algorithms. Quantum variational machine learning algorithms are currently the most prevalent but face issues with trainability due to vanishing gradients. An emerging alternative is the quantum reservoir computing ({QRC}) approach, in which the quantum algorithm does not require gradient evaluation on quantum hardware. Motivated by the potential advantages of the {QRC} method, we apply it to predict the biological activity of potential drug molecules based on molecular descriptors. We observe more robust {QRC} performance as the size of the dataset decreases, compared to standard classical models, a quality of potential interest for pharmaceutical datasets of limited size. In addition, we leverage the uniform manifold approximation and projection technique to analyze structural changes as classical features are transformed through quantum dynamics and find that quantum reservoir embeddings appear to be more interpretable in lower dimensions.},

	abstract = {Quantum machine learning has gained considerable attention as quantum technology advances, presenting a promising approach for efficiently learning complex data patterns. Despite this promise, most contemporary quantum methods require significant resources for variational parameter optimization and face issues with vanishing gradients, leading to experiments that are either limited in scale or lack potential for quantum advantage. To address this, we develop a general-purpose, gradient-free, and scalable quantum reservoir learning algorithm that harnesses the quantum dynamics of neutral-atom analog quantum computers to process data. We experimentally implement the algorithm, achieving competitive performance across various categories of machine learning tasks, including binary and multi-class classification, as well as timeseries prediction. Effective and improving learning is observed with increasing system sizes of up to 108 qubits, demonstrating the largest quantum machine learning experiment to date. We further observe comparative quantum kernel advantage in learning tasks by constructing synthetic datasets based on the geometric differences between generated quantum and classical data kernels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing classically intractable quantum correlations for effective machine learning. We expect these results to stimulate further extensions to different quantum hardware and machine learning paradigms, including early fault-tolerant hardware and generative machine learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Quantum phase estimation ({QPE}) serves as a building block of many different quantum algorithms and finds important applications in computational chemistry problems. Despite the rapid development of quantum hardware, experimental demonstration of {QPE} for chemistry problems remains challenging due to its large circuit depth and the lack of quantum resources to protect the hardware from noise with fully fault-tolerant protocols. In the present work, we take a step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing by demonstrating a {QPE} algorithm on a Quantinuum trapped-ion computer. We employ a Bayesian approach to {QPE} and introduce a routine for optimal parameter selection, which we combine with a ... quantum error detection code carefully tailored to the hardware capabilities. As a simple quantum chemistry example, we take a hydrogen molecule represented by a two-qubit Hamiltonian and estimate its ground state energy using our {QPE} protocol. In the experiment, we use the quantum circuits containing as many as 920 physical two-qubit gates to estimate the ground state energy within ... hartree of the exact value.},

Quantum computing, still in its infancy, is a costly technology that can operate in highly isolated environments because of its rapid response to environmental factors. This makes quantum computing a challenging technology for researchers to access. These problems can be solved by integrating quantum computing into an isolated remote server, such as a cloud, and making it available to users. Furthermore, experts predict that quantum computing, with its ability to swiftly resolve complex and computationally intensive operations, will offer significant benefits in systems that process large amounts of data, like cloud computing. This article presents the vision and challenges for the quantum cloud computing paradigm that will emerge with the integration of quantum and cloud computing. Next, we present the advantages of quantum computing over classical computing applications. We analyze the effects of quantum computing on cloud systems, such as cost, security, and scalability. Besides all of these advantages, we highlight research gaps in quantum cloud computing, such as qubit stability and efficient resource allocation.

            Conformal truncation is a powerful numerical method for solving generic strongly-coupled quantum field theories based on purely field-theoretic technics without introducing lattice regularization. We discuss possible speedups for performing those computations using quantum devices, with the help of near-term and future quantum algorithms. We show that this construction is very similar to quantum simulation problems appearing in quantum chemistry (which are widely investigated in quantum information science), and the renormalization group theory provides a field theory interpretation of conformal truncation simulation. Taking two-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ({QCD}) as an example, we give various explicit calculations of variational and digital quantum simulations in the level of theories, classical trials, or quantum simulators from {IBM}, including adiabatic state preparation, variational quantum eigensolver, imaginary time evolution, and quantum Lanczos algorithm. Our work shows that quantum computation could not only help us understand fundamental physics in the lattice approximation, but also simulate quantum field theory methods directly, which are widely used in particle and nuclear physics, sharpening the statement of the quantum Church-Turing Thesis.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is caused by a variety of genetic mutations, which makes every instance of the disease unique. Since chemotherapy can have extremely severe side effects, each patient requires a personalized treatment plan. Finding the dosages that maximize the beneficial effects of the drugs and minimize their adverse side effects is vital. Deep neural networks automate and improve drug selection. However, they require a lot of data to be trained on. Therefore, there is a need for machine-learning approaches that require less data. Hybrid quantum neural networks were shown to provide a potential advantage in problems where training data availability is limited. We propose a novel hybrid quantum neural network for drug response prediction, based on a combination of convolutional, graph convolutional, and deep quantum neural layers of 8 qubits with 363 layers. We test our model on the reduced Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer dataset and show that the hybrid quantum model outperforms its classical analog by 15\% in predicting {IC}50 drug effectiveness values. The proposed hybrid quantum machine learning model is a step towards deep quantum data-efficient algorithms with thousands of quantum gates for solving problems in personalized medicine, where data collection is a challenge.},

	abstract = {The digitization of healthcare presents numerous challenges, including the complexity of biological systems, vast data generation, and the need for personalized treatment plans. Traditional computational methods often fall short, leading to delayed and sometimes ineffective diagnoses and treatments. Quantum Computing ({QC}) and Quantum Machine Learning ({QML}) offer transformative advancements with the potential to revolutionize medicine. This paper summarizes areas where {QC} promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of {QC}. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, formal optimization techniques can (4) enhance the efficiency and performance of quantum algorithms by reducing resource usage, such as the number of qubits and gate operations. Therefore, we posit that formal methods can significantly contribute to enabling {QC} to realize its full potential as a game changer in precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids is known as the protein folding problem. Due to the central role of proteins’ structures in chemistry, biology and medicine applications, this subject has been intensively studied for over half a century. Although classical algorithms provide practical solutions for the sampling of the conformation space of small proteins, they cannot tackle the intrinsic {NP}-hard complexity of the problem, even when reduced to the simplest Hydrophobic-Polar model. On the other hand, while fault-tolerant quantum computers are beyond reach for state-of-the-art quantum technologies, there is evidence that quantum algorithms can be successfully used in noisy state-of-the-art quantum computers to accelerate energy optimization in frustrated systems. In this work, we present a model Hamiltonian with \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(\{N\}{\textasciicircum}\{4\})\$\$scaling and a corresponding quantum variational algorithm for the folding of a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice. The model reflects many physico-chemical properties of the protein, reducing the gap between coarse-grained representations and mere lattice models. In addition, we use a robust and versatile optimization scheme, bringing together variational quantum algorithms specifically adapted to classical cost functions and evolutionary strategies to simulate the folding of the 10 amino acid Angiotensin on 22 qubits. The same method is also successfully applied to the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptide using 9 qubits on an {IBM} 20-qubit quantum computer. Bringing together recent advances in building gate-based quantum computers with noise-tolerant hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, this work paves the way towards accessible and relevant scientific experiments on real quantum processors.},

Description of protein-like properties are more accurately described by generalized models, such as the one proposed by Miyazawa and Jernigan ({MJ}), which explicitly take into account the unique interactions among all 20 amino acids.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1707.00934},
	abstract = {An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectly replicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown quantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous teleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or terrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a global-scale "quantum internet" is to significantly extend the range for teleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite platform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points on the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons' propagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up to 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric turbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a compact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam divergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking ({APT}). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the classical limit. This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-link for faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential step toward global-scale quantum internet.},

	abstract = {Building a practical quantum processor involves integrating millions of physical qubits along with the necessary components for individual qubit manipulation and readout. Arrays of gated silicon spins offer a promising route toward achieving this goal. Optimized radio frequency resonators with high internal quality factor are based on superconducting inductors and enable fast spin readout. All-electrical spin control and gate-dispersive readout remove the need for additional device components and simplify scaling. However, superconducting high-Q tank circuits are susceptible to crosstalk-induced ringup from electrical qubit control pulses, which causes fluctuations of the quantum dot potential and is suspected to degrade qubit performance. Here, we report on the coherent and all-electrical control of a hole spin qubit at 1.5K, integrated into a silicon fin field-effect transistor and connected to a niobium nitride nanowire inductor gate-sensor. Our experiments show that qubit control pulses with their broad range of higher harmonics ring up the tank when the control pulse spectrum overlaps with the tank resonance. This can cause a reduction of the readout visibility if the tank ringing amplitude exceeds the excited state splitting of the quantum dot, lifting Pauli spin blockade and thus leading to state preparation and measurement errors. We demonstrate how to circumvent these effects by engineering control pulses around the tank resonances. Importantly, we find that the ringup does not limit the spin coherence time, indicating that efficient high-Q resonators in gate-sensing are compatible with all-electrical spin control.},

The recursive algorithm reduces the number of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum bits.},

For select energy grid optimization problems, we demonstrate exponential classical optimizer runtime scaling even for small problem instances, and present initial findings that variational quantum algorithms such as {QAOA} and hybrid quantum annealing solvers may provide more favourable runtime scaling to obtain similar solution quality. These initial results suggest that quantum computing may be a key enabling technology in the future energy transition insofar that they may be able to solve business problems which are already challenging at small problem instance sizes.},

The evaluation of each project covers characteristics such as documentation, licence, the choice of programming language, compliance with norms of software engineering, and the culture of the project. We find that while the diversity of projects is mesmerizing, only a few attract external developers and even many commercially backed frameworks have shortcomings in software engineering.

Building on the work of hybrid (physics + {AI}) {ESMs}, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in {ESMs} even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimisation problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in {ESMs}, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models.

Quantum algorithms can accelerate the identification of genetic markers associated with diseases, facilitate the analysis of medical images, and optimize treatment plans based on individual genetic profiles. Moreover, quantum cryptography offers a robust security solution for safeguarding sensitive patient data, a critical need as healthcare increasingly relies on digital platforms. Despite the promising outlook, the integration of quantum computing into healthcare faces technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. The delicate nature of quantum hardware, the need for error correction, and the scalability of quantum systems pose barriers to widespread adoption. Additionally, concerns around patient privacy and data security, as well as the need for updated regulatory frameworks, must be addressed. Ongoing research and collaborative efforts involving researchers, healthcare providers, and technology developers are crucial to overcoming these hurdles and realizing the full potential of quantum computing in transforming healthcare. As quantum computing continues to evolve, its impact on the future of healthcare could be profound, leading to earlier disease detection, more personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. For instance, quantum computing has already been applied to enhance drug discovery processes, with companies like D-Wave Systems (Burnaby, Canada) demonstrating faster molecular simulations for pharmaceutical research and {IBM}'s (Armonk, {USA}) quantum systems being used to model chemical reactions for new drug development.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has rapidly advanced in recent years due to substantial development in both hardware and algorithms. These advances are carrying quantum computers closer to their impending commercial utility. Drug discovery is a promising area of application that will find a number of uses for these new machines. As a prominent example, quantum simulation will enable faster and more accurate characterizations of molecular systems than existing quantum chemistry methods. Furthermore, algorithmic developments in quantum machine learning offer interesting alternatives to classical machine learning techniques, which may also be useful for the biochemical efforts involved in early phases of drug discovery. Meanwhile, quantum hardware is scaling up rapidly into a regime where an exact simulation is difficult even using the world’s largest supercomputers. We review how these recent advances can shift the paradigm with which one thinks about drug discovery, focusing on both the promises and caveats associated with each development. In particular, we highlight how hybrid quantum-classical approaches to quantum simulation and quantum machine learning could yield substantial progress using noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, whereas fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computers are still in their development phase.},

The rapid emergence of quantum computing in health and medicine necessitates a mapping of the landscape. In this review, clinical and medical proof-of-concept quantum computing applications are outlined and put into perspective. These consist of over 40 experimental and theoretical studies. The use case areas span genomics, clinical research and discovery, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions. Quantum machine learning ({QML}) in particular has rapidly evolved and shown to be competitive with classical benchmarks in recent medical research. Near-term {QML} algorithms have been trained with diverse clinical and real-world data sets. This includes studies in generating new molecular entities as drug candidates, diagnosing based on medical image classification, predicting patient persistence, forecasting treatment effectiveness, and tailoring radiotherapy. The use cases and algorithms are summarized and an outlook on medicine in the quantum era, including technical and ethical challenges, is provided.},

For example, we can perform a Database Search in a time which is Quadratic-ally faster than the primitive search algorithm.

Numerical modelling of weather and climate has seen tremendous improvements in the last five decades, yet stringent limitations remain to be overcome. Spatially and temporally localized forecasting is the need of the hour for effective adaptation measures towards minimizing the loss of life and property. Artificial Intelligence based methods are demonstrating promising results in improving predictions, but are still limited by the availability of requisite hardware and software required to process the vast deluge of data at a scale of the planet Earth.

These can be realized through innovative strategies to provide viable, economically competitive, and scalable technologies ranging across various sectors. Quantum computing ({QC}) has the potential to revolutionize various domains of science and engineering, including macro-energy systems and sustainable energy materials design. Conventional approaches for renewable and sustainable energy systems solely rely on classical computing techniques that may not scale well with the increasing size and complexity of applications. Owing to the advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms, {QC} and quantum artificial intelligence make promising tools to handle renewable and sustainable energy systems even at larger scales. In this review, we discuss the prospects of {QC} for various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change. In addition to providing a brief background on the operations of quantum computers, the constituent segments of widely adopted {QC}-based techniques that improve the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for sustainable energy materials along with quantum artificial intelligence methods that can address complex optimization and machine learning problems arising in renewable energy systems are also introduced in this paper. We screen the presented quantum algorithms based on their performance on current quantum devices despite their promising potential. Furthermore, sustainable energy applications that may draw advantages from {QC}-based strategies are identified in this work while simultaneously setting realistic expectations over the potential improvements offered over classical techniques.},

	abstract = {As we begin to reach the limits of classical computing, quantum computing has emerged as a technology that has captured the imagination of the scientific world. While for many years, the ability to execute quantum algorithms was only a theoretical possibility, recent advances in hardware mean that quantum computing devices now exist that can carry out quantum computation on a limited scale. Thus it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this time, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of interest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum computers is Feynman's idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. Such systems are found across chemistry, physics, and materials science. The particular way in which quantum computing extends classical computing means that one cannot expect arbitrary simulations to be sped up by a quantum computer, thus one must carefully identify areas where quantum advantage may be achieved. In this review, we briefly describe central problems in chemistry and materials science, in areas of electronic structure, quantum statistical mechanics, and quantum dynamics, that are of potential interest for solution on a quantum computer. We then take a detailed snapshot of current progress in quantum algorithms for ground-state, dynamics, and thermal state simulation, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for future developments.},

	abstract = {Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.},

This has implications for finance and healthcare, where confidentiality is paramount. The development of quantum computers also raises concerns about quantum supremacy, where a small group or organization possesses technology beyond the capabilities of governments or other entities. Furthermore, the use of quantum computing in machine learning and artificial intelligence raises concerns about bias and transparency. A multidisciplinary approach involving experts from physics, computer science, philosophy, and law is required to ensure responsible development and deployment of quantum technologies. This includes developing new frameworks for ensuring confidentiality and preventing quantum supremacy.},

Quantum computing is a fast evolving technology that promises to completely shift the computational capabilities in many areas of chemical research by bringing into reach currently impossible calculations. This perspective illustrates the near-future applicability of quantum computation of molecules to pharmaceutical problems. We briefly summarize and compare the scaling properties of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms and provide novel estimates of the quantum computational cost of simulating progressively larger embedding regions of a pharmaceutically relevant covalent protein–drug complex involving the drug Ibrutinib. Carrying out these calculations requires an error-corrected quantum architecture that we describe. Our estimates showcase that recent developments on quantum phase estimation algorithms have dramatically reduced the quantum resources needed to run fully quantum calculations in active spaces of around 50 orbitals and electrons, from estimated over 1000 years using the Trotterization approach to just a few days with sparse qubitization, painting a picture of fast and exciting progress in this nascent field.},

              The rapid advancement of quantum computing has sparked a considerable increase in research attention to quantum technologies. These advances span fundamental theoretical inquiries into quantum information and the exploration of diverse applications arising from this evolving quantum computing paradigm. The scope of the related research is notably diverse. This paper consolidates and presents quantum computing research related to the financial sector. The finance applications considered in this study include portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing and risk calculation. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of quantum computing’s applications and effects on blockchain technologies, particularly in relation to cryptocurrencies, which are central to financial technology research. As discussed in this study, quantum computing applications in finance are based on fundamental quantum physics principles and key quantum algorithms. This review aims to bridge the research gap between quantum computing and finance. We adopt a two-fold methodology, involving an analysis of
              quantum algorithms
              , followed by a discussion of
              their applications
              in specific financial contexts. Our study is based on an extensive review of online academic databases, search tools, online journal repositories, and whitepapers from 1952 to 2023, including {CiteSeerX}, {DBLP}, {ResearchGate}, Semantic Scholar, and scientific conference publications. We present state-of-the-art findings at the intersection of finance and quantum technology and highlight open research questions that will be valuable for industry practitioners and academicians as they shape future research agendas.},

This article proposes a conceptual framework for Responsible {QT} that seeks to integrate considerations about ethical, legal, social, and policy implications ({ELSPI}) into quantum R\&amp;D, while responding to the Responsible Research and Innovation dimensions of anticipation, inclusion, reflection and responsiveness. After examining what makes {QT} unique, we argue that quantum innovation should be guided by a methodological framework for Responsible {QT}, aimed at jointly safeguarding against risks by proactively addressing them, engaging stakeholders in the innovation process, and continue advancing {QT} ({SEA}). We further suggest operationalizing the {SEA}-framework by establishing quantum-specific guiding principles. The impact of quantum computing on information security is used as a case study to illustrate (1) the need for a framework that guides Responsible {QT}, and (2) the usefulness of the {SEA}-framework for {QT} generally. Additionally, we examine how our proposed {SEA}-framework for responsible innovation can inform the emergent regulatory landscape affecting {QT}, and provide an outlook of how regulatory interventions for {QT} as base-layer technology could be designed, contextualized, and tailored to their exceptional nature in order to reduce the risk of unintended counterproductive effects of policy interventions. Laying the groundwork for a responsible quantum ecosystem, the research community and other stakeholders are called upon to further develop the recommended guiding principles, and discuss their operationalization into best practices and real-world applications. Our proposed framework should be considered a starting point for these much needed, highly interdisciplinary efforts.},

	abstract = {Quantum information technologies, covering quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing, are among the most significant technologies to emerge in recent decades, offering the promise of paradigm-shifting computational capacity with significant ethical consequences. On a technical level, the unique features of quantum information processing have consequences for the imposition of fairness and ethical constraints on computation. Despite its significance, little if no structured research has been undertaken into the ethical implications of such quantum technologies. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature by presenting a roadmap for ethical quantum computing (and quantum information processing more generally) that sets out prospective research programmes. We summarise the key elements of quantum information processing (focusing on quantum computation) relevant to ethical analysis and set-out taxonomies for use by researchers considering the ethics of quantum technologies. In particular, we demonstrate how the unique features of quantum information processing gives rise to distinct ethical consequences (including in the context of machine learning). We situate quantum ethics at the cross-disciplinary intersection of quantum information science, technology ethics and moral philosophy to assess the impacts of this newly emerging technology. We provide specific examples of how the emergence of quantum technologies gives rise to normative and distributional ethical challenges. Finally, we set out prospective research directions to help inaugurate the cross-disciplinary field of the ethics of quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is the latest revolution in computing and will probably come to be seen as an advance as important as the steam engine or the information society. In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.},

In this article, we introduce Qrisp, a framework designed to bridge several gaps between high-level programming paradigms in state-of-the-art software engineering and the physical reality of today's quantum hardware. The framework aims to provide a systematic approach to quantum algorithm development such that they can be effortlessly implemented, maintained and improved. We propose a number of programming abstractions that are inspired by classical paradigms, yet consistently focus on the particular needs of a quantum developer. Unlike many other high-level language approaches, Qrisp's standout feature is its ability to compile programs to the circuit level, making them executable on most existing physical backends. The introduced abstractions enable the Qrisp compiler to leverage algorithm structure for increased compilation efficiency. Finally, we present a set of code examples, including an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm. For the latter, the resulting circuit shows significantly reduced quantum resource requirements, strongly supporting the claim that systematic quantum algorithm development can give quantitative benefits.},

	abstract = {With the potential of quantum algorithms to solve intractable classical problems, quantum computing is rapidly evolving, and more algorithms are being developed and optimized. Expressing these quantum algorithms using a high-level language and making them executable on a quantum processor while abstracting away hardware details is a challenging task. First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations. In this article, we propose a quantum programming framework named {OpenQL}, which includes a high-level quantum programming language and its associated quantum compiler. We present the programming interface of {OpenQL}, we describe the different layers of the compiler and how we can provide portability over different qubit technologies. Our experiments show that {OpenQL} allows the execution of the same high-level algorithm on two different qubit technologies, namely superconducting qubits and Si-Spin qubits. Besides the executable code, {OpenQL} also produces an intermediate quantum assembly code, which is technology independent and can be simulated using the {QX} simulator.},

This review provides an insight into quantum computing models coupled with the identification of some pros and cons. The main contribution of this systematic review is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art models of quantum computing in various domains. It provides new classifications of quantum models based on the literature reviewed and links results to that of the four major categories of quantum computing models. Assessment reveals that most of the models reviewed are either mathematical or algorithmic even though they are based on quantum operations and circuits.},

However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 109 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

            This paper intends to contribute to the emerging literature on the ethical problems posed by quantum computing and quantum technologies in general. The key ethical questions are as follows: Does quantum computing pose new ethical problems, or are those raised by quantum computing just a different version of the same ethical problems raised by other technologies, such as nanotechnologies, nuclear plants, or cloud computing? In other words, what is new in quantum computing from an ethical point of view? The paper aims to answer these two questions by (a) developing an analysis of the existing literature on the ethical and social aspects of quantum computing and (b) identifying and analyzing the main ethical problems posed by quantum computing. The conclusion is that quantum computing poses completely new ethical issues that require new conceptual tools and methods.},
